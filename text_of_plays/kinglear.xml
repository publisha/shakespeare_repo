<stage_directions>Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. [Kent and Glouceste converse. Edmund stands back.] </stage_directions>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than </verseline>
<character>Cornwall </character>
<prose>It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for equalities are so weigh&#8217;d that curiosity in neither can make choice of either&#8217;s moiety</prose>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Is not this your son, my lord? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<prose>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so often blush&#8217;d to acknowledge him that now I am braz&#8217;d to&#8217;t</prose>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>I cannot conceive you</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<prose>Sir, this young fellow&#8217;s mother could; whereupon she grew round-womb&#8217;d, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault? </prose>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<prose>But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged.-Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund? </prose>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[comes forward]</stage_directions_inline> No, my lord</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<prose>My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable friend</prose>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>My services to your lordship</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>I must love you, and sue to know you better</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Sir, I shall study deserving</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again</verseline>
<verseline>Sound a sennet</verseline>
<verseline>The King is coming</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with Followers</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>I shall, my liege</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund].</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose</verseline>
<verseline>Give me the map there. Know we have divided </verseline>
<verseline>In three our kingdom; and &#8216;tis our fast intent </verseline>
<verseline>To shake all cares and business from our age, </verseline>
<verseline>Conferring them on younger strengths while we </verseline>
<verseline>Unburthen&#8217;d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall, </verseline>
<verseline>And you, our no less loving son of Albany, </verseline>
<verseline>We have this hour a constant will to publish </verseline>
<verseline>Our daughters&#8217; several dowers, that future strife </verseline>
<verseline>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy, </verseline>
<verseline>Great rivals in our youngest daughter&#8217;s love, </verseline>
<verseline>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn, </verseline>
<verseline>And here are to be answer&#8217;d. Tell me, my daughters </verseline>
<verseline>(Since now we will divest us both of rule, </verseline>
<verseline>Interest of territory, cares of state), </verseline>
<verseline>Which of you shall we say doth love us most? </verseline>
<verseline>That we our largest bounty may extend </verseline>
<verseline>Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril, </verseline>
<verseline>Our eldest-born, speak first</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter; </verseline>
<verseline>Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty; </verseline>
<verseline>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; </verseline>
<verseline>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour; </verseline>
<verseline>As much as child e&#8217;er lov&#8217;d, or father found; </verseline>
<verseline>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable</verseline>
<verseline>Beyond all manner of so much I love you</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[aside] </stage_directions_inline>What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, </verseline>
<verseline>With shadowy forests and with champains rich&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads, </verseline>
<verseline>We make thee lady. To thine and Albany&#8217;s issue </verseline>
<verseline>Be this perpetual. -What says our second daughter, </verseline>
<verseline>Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Sir, I am made </verseline>
<verseline>Of the selfsame metal that my sister is, </verseline>
<verseline>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart </verseline>
<verseline>I find she names my very deed of love; </verseline>
<verseline>Only she comes too short, that I profess </verseline>
<verseline>Myself an enemy to all other joys </verseline>
<verseline>Which the most precious square of sense possesses, </verseline>
<verseline>And find I am alone felicitate </verseline>
<verseline>In your dear Highness&#8217; love</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[aside]</stage_directions_inline> Then poor Cordelia! </verseline>
<verseline>And yet not so; since I am sure my love&#8217;s </verseline>
<verseline>More richer than my tongue</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>To thee and thine hereditary ever </verseline>
<verseline>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom, </verseline>
<verseline>No less in space, validity, and pleasure </verseline>
<verseline>Than that conferr&#8217;d on Goneril. --Now, our joy, </verseline>
<verseline>Although the last, not least; to whose young love </verseline>
<verseline>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy </verseline>
<verseline>Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw </verseline>
<verseline>A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Nothing, my lord</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Nothing? </verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Nothing</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave </verseline>
<verseline>My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty </verseline>
<verseline>According to my bond; no more nor less</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little, </verseline>
<verseline>Lest it may mar your fortunes</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Good my lord, </verseline>
<verseline>You have begot me, bred me, lov&#8217;d me; I </verseline>
<verseline>Return those duties back as are right fit, </verseline>
<verseline>Obey you, love you, and most honour you</verseline>
<verseline>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say </verseline>
<verseline>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, </verseline>
<verseline>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry </verseline>
<verseline>Half my love with him, half my care and duty</verseline>
<verseline>Sure I shall never marry like my sisters, </verseline>
<verseline>To love my father all</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>But goes thy heart with this? </verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Ay, good my lord</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>So young, and so untender? </verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>So young, my lord, and true</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower! </verseline>
<verseline>For, by the sacred radiance of the sun, </verseline>
<verseline>The mysteries of Hecate and the night; </verseline>
<verseline>By all the operation of the orbs </verseline>
<verseline>From whom we do exist and cease to be; </verseline>
<verseline>Here I disclaim all my paternal care, </verseline>
<verseline>Propinquity and property of blood, </verseline>
<verseline>And as a stranger to my heart and me </verseline>
<verseline>Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian, </verseline>
<verseline>Or he that makes his generation messes </verseline>
<verseline>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom </verseline>
<verseline>Be as well neighbour&#8217;d, pitied, and reliev&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>As thou my sometime daughter</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Good my liege- </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Peace, Kent! </verseline>
<verseline>Come not between the dragon and his wrath</verseline>
<verseline>I lov&#8217;d her most, and thought to set my rest </verseline>
<verseline>On her kind nursery.-Hence and avoid my sight!- </verseline>
<verseline>So be my grave my peace as here I give </verseline>
<verseline>Her father&#8217;s heart from her! Call France! Who stirs? </verseline>
<verseline>Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany, </verseline>
<verseline>With my two daughters&#8217; dowers digest this third; </verseline>
<verseline>Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her</verseline>
<verseline>I do invest you jointly in my power, </verseline>
<verseline>Preeminence, and all the large effects </verseline>
<verseline>That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, </verseline>
<verseline>With reservation of an hundred knights, </verseline>
<verseline>By you to be sustain&#8217;d, shall our abode </verseline>
<verseline>Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain </verseline>
<verseline>The name, and all th&#8217; additions to a king. The sway, </verseline>
<verseline>Revenue, execution of the rest, </verseline>
<verseline>Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm, </verseline>
<verseline>This coronet part betwixt you</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Royal Lear, </verseline>
<verseline>Whom I have ever honour&#8217;d as my king, </verseline>
<verseline>Lov&#8217;d as my father, as my master follow&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>As my great patron thought on in my prayers- </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Let it fall rather, though the fork invade </verseline>
<verseline>The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly </verseline>
<verseline>When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man? </verseline>
<verseline>Think&#8217;st thou that duty shall have dread to speak </verseline>
<verseline>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour&#8217;s bound </verseline>
<verseline>When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom; </verseline>
<verseline>And in thy best consideration check </verseline>
<verseline>This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment, </verseline>
<verseline>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least, </verseline>
<verseline>Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound </verseline>
<verseline>Reverbs no hollowness</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Kent, on thy life, no more! </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>My life I never held but as a pawn </verseline>
<verseline>To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it, </verseline>
<verseline>Thy safety being the motive</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Out of my sight! </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>See better, Lear, and let me still remain </verseline>
<verseline>The true blank of thine eye</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Now by Apollo- </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Now by Apollo, King, </verseline>
<verseline>Thou swear&#8217;st thy gods in vain</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>O vassal! miscreant! </verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Lays his hand on his sword.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>Albany., Cornwall. Dear sir, forbear! </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Do! </verseline>
<verseline>Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow </verseline>
<verseline>Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift, </verseline>
<verseline>Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll tell thee thou dost evil</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Hear me, recreant! </verseline>
<verseline>On thine allegiance, hear me! </verseline>
<verseline>Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow- </verseline>
<verseline>Which we durst never yet-and with strain&#8217;d pride </verseline>
<verseline>To come between our sentence and our power,- </verseline>
<verseline>Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,- </verseline>
<verseline>Our potency made good, take thy reward</verseline>
<verseline>Five days we do allot thee for provision </verseline>
<verseline>To shield thee from diseases of the world, </verseline>
<verseline>And on the sixth to turn thy hated back </verseline>
<verseline>Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following, </verseline>
<verseline>Thy banish&#8217;d trunk be found in our dominions, </verseline>
<verseline>The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter, </verseline>
<verseline>This shall not be revok&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear, </verseline>
<verseline>Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[To Cordelia]</stage_directions_inline> The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid, </verseline>
<verseline>That justly think&#8217;st and hast most rightly said! </verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[To Regan and Goneril]</stage_directions_inline> And your large speeches may your deeds </verseline>
<verseline>approve, </verseline>
<verseline>That good effects may spring from words of love</verseline>
<verseline>Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu; </verseline>
<verseline>He&#8217;ll shape his old course in a country new</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>Exit.</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Flourish</character>
<verseline>Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy; Attendants</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Here&#8217;s France and Burgundy, my noble lord</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>My Lord of Burgundy, </verseline>
<verseline>We first address toward you, who with this king </verseline>
<verseline>Hath rivall&#8217;d for our daughter. What in the least </verseline>
<verseline>Will you require in present dower with her, </verseline>
<verseline>Or cease your quest of love? </verseline>
<character>Burgundy</character>
<verseline>Most royal Majesty, </verseline>
<verseline>I crave no more than hath your Highness offer&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>Nor will you tender less</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Right noble Burgundy, </verseline>
<verseline>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; </verseline>
<verseline>But now her price is fall&#8217;n. Sir, there she stands</verseline>
<verseline>If aught within that little seeming substance, </verseline>
<verseline>Or all of it, with our displeasure piec&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace, </verseline>
<verseline>She&#8217;s there, and she is yours</verseline>
<character>Burgundy</character>
<verseline>I know no answer</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Will you, with those infirmities she owes, </verseline>
<verseline>Unfriended, new adopted to our hate, </verseline>
<verseline>Dow&#8217;r&#8217;d with our curse, and stranger&#8217;d with our oath, </verseline>
<verseline>Take her, or leave her? </verseline>
<character>Burgundy</character>
<verseline>Pardon me, royal sir</verseline>
<verseline>Election makes not up on such conditions</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow&#8217;r that made me, </verseline>
<verseline>I tell you all her wealth.<stage_directions_inline> [To France]</stage_directions_inline> For you, great King, </verseline>
<verseline>I would not from your love make such a stray </verseline>
<verseline>To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you </verseline>
<verseline>T&#8217; avert your liking a more worthier way </verseline>
<verseline>Than on a wretch whom nature is asham&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>Almost t&#8217; acknowledge hers</verseline>
<character>France</character>
<verseline>This is most strange, </verseline>
<verseline>That she that even but now was your best object, </verseline>
<verseline>The argument of your praise, balm of your age, </verseline>
<verseline>Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time </verseline>
<verseline>Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle </verseline>
<verseline>So many folds of favour. Sure her offence </verseline>
<verseline>Must be of such unnatural degree </verseline>
<verseline>That monsters it, or your fore-vouch&#8217;d affection </verseline>
<verseline>Fall&#8217;n into taint; which to believe of her </verseline>
<verseline>Must be a faith that reason without miracle </verseline>
<verseline>Should never plant in me</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>I yet beseech your Majesty, </verseline>
<verseline>If for I want that glib and oily art </verseline>
<verseline>To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll do&#8217;t before I speak-that you make known </verseline>
<verseline>It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness, </verseline>
<verseline>No unchaste action or dishonoured step, </verseline>
<verseline>That hath depriv&#8217;d me of your grace and favour; </verseline>
<verseline>But even for want of that for which I am richer- </verseline>
<verseline>A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue </verseline>
<verseline>As I am glad I have not, though not to have it </verseline>
<verseline>Hath lost me in your liking</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Better thou </verseline>
<verseline>Hadst not been born than not t&#8217; have pleas&#8217;d me better</verseline>
<character>France</character>
<verseline>Is it but this-a tardiness in nature </verseline>
<verseline>Which often leaves the history unspoke </verseline>
<verseline>That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy, </verseline>
<verseline>What say you to the lady? Love&#8217;s not love </verseline>
<verseline>When it is mingled with regards that stands </verseline>
<verseline>Aloof from th&#8217; entire point. Will you have her? </verseline>
<verseline>She is herself a dowry</verseline>
<character>Burgundy</character>
<verseline>Royal Lear, </verseline>
<verseline>Give but that portion which yourself propos&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>And here I take Cordelia by the hand, </verseline>
<verseline>Duchess of Burgundy</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm</verseline>
<character>Burgundy</character>
<verseline>I am sorry then you have so lost a father </verseline>
<verseline>That you must lose a husband</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Peace be with Burgundy! </verseline>
<verseline>Since that respects of fortune are his love, </verseline>
<verseline>I shall not be his wife</verseline>
<character>France</character>
<verseline>Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor; </verseline>
<verseline>Most choice, forsaken; and most lov&#8217;d, despis&#8217;d! </verseline>
<verseline>Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon</verseline>
<verseline>Be it lawful I take up what&#8217;s cast away</verseline>
<verseline>Gods, gods! &#8216;tis strange that from their cold&#8217;st neglect </verseline>
<verseline>My love should kindle to inflam&#8217;d respect</verseline>
<verseline>Thy dow&#8217;rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance, </verseline>
<verseline>Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France</verseline>
<verseline>Not all the dukes in wat&#8217;rish Burgundy </verseline>
<verseline>Can buy this unpriz&#8217;d precious maid of me</verseline>
<verseline>Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind</verseline>
<verseline>Thou losest here, a better where to find</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we </verseline>
<verseline>Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see </verseline>
<verseline>That face of hers again. Therefore be gone </verseline>
<verseline>Without our grace, our love, our benison</verseline>
<verseline>Come, noble Burgundy</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester, and Attendants].</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>France</character>
<verseline>Bid farewell to your sisters</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>The jewels of our father, with wash&#8217;d eyes </verseline>
<verseline>Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are; </verseline>
<verseline>And, like a sister, am most loath to call </verseline>
<verseline>Your faults as they are nam&#8217;d. Use well our father</verseline>
<verseline>To your professed bosoms I commit him; </verseline>
<verseline>But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, </verseline>
<verseline>I would prefer him to a better place! </verseline>
<verseline>So farewell to you both</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Prescribe not us our duties</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Let your study </verseline>
<verseline>Be to content your lord, who hath receiv&#8217;d you </verseline>
<verseline>At fortune&#8217;s alms. You have obedience scanted, </verseline>
<verseline>And well are worth the want that you have wanted</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides</verseline>
<verseline>Who cover faults, at last shame them derides</verseline>
<verseline>Well may you prosper! </verseline>
<character>France</character>
<verseline>Come, my fair Cordelia</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>Exeunt France and Cordelia</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<prose>Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night</prose>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>That&#8217;s most certain, and with you; next month with us</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<prose>You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we have made of it hath not been little. He always lov&#8217;d our sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly</prose>
<character>Regan</character>
<prose>&#8216;Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself</prose>
<character>Goneril</character>
<prose>The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look to receive from his age, not alone the imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardnes that infirm and choleric years bring with them</prose>
<character>Regan</character>
<prose>Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent&#8217;s banishment</prose>
<character>Goneril</character>
<prose>There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you let&#8217;s hit together. If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us</prose>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>We shall further think on&#8217;t</verseline>

<stage_directions>Enter Edmund the Bastard solus, with a letter</stage_directions>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law </verseline>
<verseline>My services are bound. Wherefore should I </verseline>
<verseline>Stand in the plague of custom, and permit </verseline>
<verseline>The curiosity of nations to deprive me, </verseline>
<verseline>For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines </verseline>
<verseline>Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base? </verseline>
<verseline>When my dimensions are as well compact, </verseline>
<verseline>My mind as generous, and my shape as true, </verseline>
<verseline>As honest madam&#8217;s issue? Why brand they us </verseline>
<verseline>With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base? </verseline>
<verseline>Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take </verseline>
<verseline>More composition and fierce quality </verseline>
<verseline>Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed, </verseline>
<verseline>Go to th&#8217; creating a whole tribe of fops </verseline>
<verseline>Got &#8216;tween asleep and wake? Well then, </verseline>
<verseline>Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land</verseline>
<verseline>Our father&#8217;s love is to the bastard Edmund </verseline>
<verseline>As to th&#8217; legitimate. Fine word-&#8217;legitimate&#8217;! </verseline>
<verseline>Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed, </verseline>
<verseline>And my invention thrive, Edmund the base </verseline>
<verseline>Shall top th&#8217; legitimate. I grow; I prosper</verseline>
<verseline>Now, gods, stand up for bastards! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Gloucester</stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Kent banish&#8217;d thus? and France in choler parted? </verseline>
<verseline>And the King gone to-night? subscrib&#8217;d his pow&#8217;r? </verseline>
<verseline>Confin&#8217;d to exhibition? All this done </verseline>
<verseline>Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>So please your lordship, none</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Puts up the letter.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>I know no news, my lord</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>What paper were you reading? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Nothing, my lord</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<prose>No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let&#8217;s see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles</prose>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o&#8217;er-read; and for so much as I have perus&#8217;d, I find it not fit for your o&#8217;erlooking</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Give me the letter, sir</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Let&#8217;s see, let&#8217;s see! </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>I hope, for my brother&#8217;s justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>(reads)</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffer&#8217;d. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I wak&#8217;d him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, &#8216;EDGAR.&#8217; Hum! Conspiracy? &#8216;Sleep till I wak&#8217;d him, you should enjoy half his revenue.&#8217; My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it? </prose>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>It was not brought me, my lord: there&#8217;s the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>You know the character to be your brother&#8217;s? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>It is his</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Hath he never before sounded you in this business? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<prose>O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I&#8217;ll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he? </prose>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Think you so? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very evening</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>He cannot be such a monster</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Nor is not, sure</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him</verseline>
<prose>Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution</prose>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<prose>These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg&#8217;d by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack&#8217;d </prose>
<prose>&#8216;twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there&#8217;s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there&#8217;s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish&#8217;d! his offence, honesty! &#8216;Tis strange. <stage_directions_inline>Exit.</stage_directions_inline>
</prose>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc&#8217;d obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon&#8217;s Tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing</prose>
<verseline>Edgar- </verseline>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>Enter Edgar.</stage_directions_inline> and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o&#8217; Bedlam</prose>
<verseline>O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<prose>How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are you in? </prose>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses</prose>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Do you busy yourself with that? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what</prose>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>How long have you been a sectary astronomical? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Come, come! When saw you my father last? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>The night gone by</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Spake you with him? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Ay, two hours together</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance </prose>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>None at all</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay</prose>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Some Villain hath done me wrong</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>That&#8217;s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. Pray ye, go! There&#8217;s my key. If you do stir abroad, go arm&#8217;d</prose>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Arm&#8217;d, brother? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<prose>Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm&#8217;d. I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you what I have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. Pray you, away! </prose>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Shall I hear from you anon? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>I do serve you in this business</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>Exit Edgar.</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>A credulous father! and a brother noble, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose nature is so far from doing harms </verseline>
<verseline>That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty </verseline>
<verseline>My practices ride easy! I see the business</verseline>
<verseline>Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit; </verseline>
<verseline>All with me&#8217;s meet that I can fashion fit</verseline>

<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool? </verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>Ay, madam</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour </verseline>
<verseline>He flashes into one gross crime or other </verseline>
<verseline>That sets us all at odds. I&#8217;ll not endure it</verseline>
<verseline>His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us </verseline>
<verseline>On every trifle. When he returns from hunting, </verseline>
<verseline>I will not speak with him. Say I am sick</verseline>
<verseline>If you come slack of former services, </verseline>
<verseline>You shall do well; the fault of it I&#8217;ll answer</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Horns within.]</stage_directions_inline>

<verseline>He&#8217;s coming, madam; I hear him</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Put on what weary negligence you please, </verseline>
<verseline>You and your fellows. I&#8217;d have it come to question</verseline>
<verseline>If he distaste it, let him to our sister, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, </verseline>
<verseline>Not to be overrul&#8217;d. Idle old man, </verseline>
<verseline>That still would manage those authorities </verseline>
<verseline>That he hath given away! Now, by my life, </verseline>
<verseline>Old fools are babes again, and must be us&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>Remember what I have said</verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>Very well, madam</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>And let his knights have colder looks among you</verseline>
<verseline>What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so</verseline>
<verseline>I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, </verseline>

<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>If but as well I other accents borrow, </verseline>
<verseline>That can my speech defuse, my good intent </verseline>
<verseline>May carry through itself to that full issue </verseline>
<verseline>For which I raz&#8217;d my likeness. Now, banish&#8217;d Kent, </verseline>
<verseline>If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov&#8217;st, </verseline>

<character>Lear</character>
<prose>Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. <stage_directions_inline>[Exit an Attendant.]</stage_directions_inline> How now? What art thou? </prose>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>A man, sir</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish</prose>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>What art thou? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King</verseline>

<prose>If thou best as poor for a subject as he&#8217;s for a king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou? </prose>
<character>Kent</character>

<verseline>You</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Dost thou know me, fellow? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master</prose>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>What&#8217;s that? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Authority</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>What services canst thou do? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence</prose>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>How old art thou? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything. I have years on my back forty-eight</prose>
<character>Lear</character>
<prose>Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner! </prose>

<verseline>Why came not the slave back to me when I call&#8217;d him </verseline>
<character>Knight</character>
<verseline>Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>He would not? </verseline>
<character>Knight</character>
<prose>My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgment your Highness is not entertain&#8217;d with that ceremonious affection as you were wont. There&#8217;s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also and your daughter</prose>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Ha! say&#8217;st thou so? </verseline>
<character>Knight</character>
<prose>I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong&#8217;d</prose>
<character>Lear</character>
<prose>Thou but rememb&#8217;rest me of mine own conception. I have perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into&#8217;t.But where&#8217;s my fool? I have not seen him this two days</prose>
<character>Knight</character>
<prose>Since my young lady&#8217;s going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away</prose>

<prose>There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish&#8217;d two son&#8217;s daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my cox-comb.-How now, nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters! </prose>

<verseline>What two crowns shall they be? </verseline>
<character>Fool</character>
<prose>Why, after I have cut the egg i&#8217; th&#8217; middle and eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i&#8217; th&#8217; middle and gav&#8217;st away both parts, thou bor&#8217;st thine ass on thy back o&#8217;er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav&#8217;st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipp&#8217;d that first finds it so</prose>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Sings]</stage_directions_inline>Fools had Deer less grace in a year, </verseline>

<verseline>They know not how their wits to wear, </verseline>
<verseline>Their manners are so apish</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah? </verseline>
<character>Fool</character>
<prose>I have us&#8217;d it, nuncle, ever since thou mad&#8217;st thy daughters thy mother; for when thou gav&#8217;st them the rod, and put&#8217;st down thine own breeches, </prose>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Sings]</stage_directions_inline>Then they for sudden joy did weep, </verseline>
<verseline>And I for sorrow sung, </verseline>
<verseline>That such a king should play bo-peep </verseline>

<prose>Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie. I would fain learn to lie</prose>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>An you lie, sirrah, we&#8217;ll have you whipp&#8217;d</verseline>

I had rather be any kind o&#8217; thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o&#8217; both sides and left nothing </prose>

<prose>How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much o&#8217; late i&#8217; th&#8217; frown</prose>

<prose>Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am better than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing</prose>

<stage_directions_inline>[To Goneril]</stage_directions_inline> Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum! </prose>

<verseline>But other of your insolent retinue </verseline>
<verseline>Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth </verseline>
<verseline>In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir, </verseline>
<verseline>I had thought, by making this well known unto you, </verseline>
<verseline>To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful, </verseline>
<verseline>By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done, </verseline>
<verseline>That you protect this course, and put it on </verseline>
<verseline>By your allowance; which if you should, the fault </verseline>
<verseline>Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep, </verseline>
<verseline>Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal, </verseline>

<verseline>Come, sir, </verseline>
<verseline>I would you would make use of that good wisdom </verseline>

<verseline>Which, like an engine, wrench&#8217;d my frame of nature </verseline>

<verseline>How comes that? </verseline>

<prose>Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad -I mean the whisper&#8217;d ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments? </prose>

<verseline>Hark, the Duke&#8217;s trumpets! I know not why he comes</verseline>
<verseline>All ports I&#8217;ll bar; the villain shall not scape; </verseline>
<verseline>The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture </verseline>
<verseline>I will send far and near, that all the kingdom </verseline>

<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>If it be true, all vengeance comes too short </verseline>
<verseline>Which can pursue th&#8217; offender. How dost, my lord? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>O madam, my old heart is crack&#8217;d, it&#8217;s crack&#8217;d! </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>What, did my father&#8217;s godson seek your life? </verseline>
<verseline>He whom my father nam&#8217;d? Your Edgar? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>O lady, lady, shame would have it hid! </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Was he not companion with the riotous knights </verseline>
<verseline>That tend upon my father? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>

<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Yes, madam, he was of that consort</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>No marvel then though he were ill affected</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis they have put him on the old man&#8217;s death, </verseline>
<verseline>To have th&#8217; expense and waste of his revenues</verseline>
<verseline>I have this present evening from my sister </verseline>
<verseline>Been well inform&#8217;d of them, and with such cautions </verseline>
<verseline>That, if they come to sojourn at my house, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll not be there</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Nor I, assure thee, Regan</verseline>
<verseline>Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father </verseline>
<verseline>A childlike office</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Twas my duty, sir</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>He did bewray his practice, and receiv&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Is he pursued? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Ay, my good lord</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>If he be taken, he shall never more </verseline>
<verseline>Be fear&#8217;d of doing harm. Make your own purpose, </verseline>
<verseline>How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant </verseline>
<verseline>So much commend itself, you shall be ours</verseline>
<verseline>Natures of such deep trust we shall much need; </verseline>
<verseline>You we first seize on</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>I shall serve you, sir, </verseline>
<verseline>Truly, however else</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>For him I thank your Grace</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>You know not why we came to visit you- </verseline>

<verseline>Thus out of season, threading dark-ey&#8217;d night</verseline>
<verseline>Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise, </verseline>
<verseline>Wherein we must have use of your advice</verseline>
<verseline>Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister, </verseline>
<verseline>Of differences, which I best thought it fit </verseline>
<verseline>To answer from our home. The several messengers </verseline>

<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Ay</verseline>

<verseline>Prithee, if thou lov&#8217;st me, tell me</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>I love thee not</verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>Why then, I care not for thee</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care for me</prose>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Fellow, I know thee</verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>What dost thou know me for? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver&#8217;d, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue; one-trunk- inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny the least syllable of thy addition</prose>
<character>Oswald</character>
<prose>Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that&#8217;s neither known of thee nor knows thee! </prose>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>What a brazen-fac&#8217;d varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! </verseline>
<prose>Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp&#8217;d up thy heels before the King? <stage_directions_inline>[Draws his sword.]</stage_directions_inline> Draw, you rogue! for, though it be night, yet the moon shines. I&#8217;ll make a sop o&#8217; th&#8217; moonshine o&#8217; you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger! draw! </prose>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>Away! I have nothing to do with thee</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King, and take Vanity the puppet&#8217;s part against the royalty of her father</prose>
<prose>Draw, you rogue, or I&#8217;ll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you rascal! Come your ways! </prose>
<character>Oswald</character>

<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>How now? What&#8217;s the matter? <stage_directions_inline>[Part them].</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I&#8217;ll flesh ye! </verseline>

<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Weapon? arms? What&#8217;s the matter here? </verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Keep peace, upon your lives! </verseline>
<verseline>He dies that strikes again. What is the matter? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>The messengers from our sister and the King </verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>What is your difference? Speak</verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>I am scarce in breath, my lord</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>No marvel, you have so bestirr&#8217;d your valour. You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee</prose>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though be had been but two hours at the trade</prose>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Speak yet, how grew your quarrel? </verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>At suit of his grey beard- </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if you&#8217;ll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. &#8216;Spare my grey beard,&#8217; you wagtail? </prose>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Peace, sirrah! </verseline>
<verseline>You beastly knave, know you no reverence? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Why art thou angry? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>That such a slave as this should wear a sword, </verseline>
<verseline>Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these, </verseline>
<verseline>Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain </verseline>
<verseline>Which are too intrinse t&#8217; unloose; smooth every passion </verseline>
<verseline>That in the natures of their lords rebel, </verseline>
<verseline>Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods; </verseline>
<verseline>Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks </verseline>
<verseline>With every gale and vary of their masters, </verseline>
<verseline>Knowing naught (like dogs) but following</verseline>
<verseline>A plague upon your epileptic visage! </verseline>
<verseline>Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool? </verseline>
<verseline>Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>What, art thou mad, old fellow? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>How fell you out? Say that</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>No contraries hold more antipathy </verseline>
<verseline>Than I and such a knave</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>His countenance likes me not</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Sir, &#8216;tis my occupation to be plain</verseline>
<verseline>I have seen better faces in my time </verseline>
<verseline>Than stands on any shoulder that I see </verseline>
<verseline>Before me at this instant</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>This is some fellow </verseline>
<verseline>Who, having been prais&#8217;d for bluntness, doth affect </verseline>
<verseline>A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb </verseline>
<verseline>Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he! </verseline>
<verseline>An honest mind and plain-he must speak truth! </verseline>
<verseline>An they will take it, so; if not, he&#8217;s plain</verseline>
<verseline>These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness </verseline>
<verseline>Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends </verseline>
<verseline>Than twenty silly-ducking observants </verseline>
<verseline>That stretch their duties nicely</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity, </verseline>
<verseline>Under th&#8217; allowance of your great aspect, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire </verseline>
<verseline>On flickering Phoebus&#8217; front- </verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>What mean&#8217;st by this? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil&#8217;d you in a plain accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to&#8217;t</prose>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>What was th&#8217; offence you gave him? </verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>I never gave him any</verseline>
<verseline>It pleas&#8217;d the King his master very late </verseline>
<verseline>To strike at me, upon his misconstruction; </verseline>
<verseline>When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure, </verseline>
<verseline>Tripp&#8217;d me behind; being down, insulted, rail&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>And put upon him such a deal of man </verseline>
<verseline>That worthied him, got praises of the King </verseline>
<verseline>For him attempting who was self-subdu&#8217;d; </verseline>
<verseline>And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit, </verseline>
<verseline>Drew on me here again</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>None of these rogues and cowards </verseline>
<verseline>But Ajax is their fool</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Fetch forth the stocks! </verseline>
<verseline>You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart, </verseline>
<verseline>We&#8217;ll teach you- </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Sir, I am too old to learn</verseline>
<verseline>Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King; </verseline>
<verseline>On whose employment I was sent to you</verseline>
<verseline>You shall do small respect, show too bold malice </verseline>
<verseline>Against the grace and person of my master, </verseline>
<verseline>Stocking his messenger</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour, </verseline>
<verseline>There shall he sit till noon</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too! </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Why, madam, if I were your father&#8217;s dog, </verseline>
<verseline>You should not use me so</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Sir, being his knave, I will</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>This is a fellow of the selfsame colour </verseline>
<verseline>Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Stocks brought out</stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Let me beseech your Grace not to do so</verseline>
<verseline>His fault is much, and the good King his master </verseline>
<verseline>Will check him for&#8217;t. Your purpos&#8217;d low correction </verseline>
<verseline>Is such as basest and contemn&#8217;dest wretches </verseline>
<verseline>For pilf&#8217;rings and most common trespasses </verseline>
<verseline>Are punish&#8217;d with. The King must take it ill </verseline>
<verseline>That he, so slightly valued in his messenger, </verseline>
<verseline>Should have him thus restrain&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll answer that</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>My sister may receive it much more worse, </verseline>
<verseline>To have her gentleman abus&#8217;d, assaulted, </verseline>
<verseline>For following her affairs. Put in his legs.- </verseline>

<prose>Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the head, dogs and bears by th&#8217; neck, monkeys by th&#8217; loins, and men by th&#8217; legs. When a man&#8217;s over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden nether-stocks</prose>

<verseline>Made you no more offence but what you speak of? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>None</verseline>
<verseline>How chance the King comes with so small a number? </verseline>
<character>Fool</character>
<prose>An thou hadst been set i&#8217; th&#8217; stocks for that question, thou&#8217;dst well deserv&#8217;d it</prose>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Why, fool? </verseline>
<character>Fool</character>
<prose>We&#8217;ll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there&#8217;s no labouring i&#8217; th&#8217; winter. All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men, and there&#8217;s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that&#8217;s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after</prose>
<prose>When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again. I would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it</prose>
<verseline>That sir which serves and seeks for gain, </verseline>
<verseline>And follows but for form, </verseline>
<verseline>Will pack when it begins to rain </verseline>
<verseline>And leave thee in the storm</verseline>
<verseline>But I will tarry; the fool will stay, </verseline>
<verseline>And let the wise man fly</verseline>
<verseline>The knave turns fool that runs away; </verseline>
<verseline>The fool no knave, perdy</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Where learn&#8217;d you this, fool? </verseline>
<character>Fool</character>
<verseline>Not i&#8217; th&#8217; stocks, fool</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Lear and Gloucester </stage_directions>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary? </verseline>
<verseline>They have travell&#8217;d all the night? Mere fetches- </verseline>
<verseline>The images of revolt and flying off! </verseline>
<verseline>Fetch me a better answer</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>My dear lord, </verseline>
<verseline>You know the fiery quality of the Duke, </verseline>
<verseline>How unremovable and fix&#8217;d he is </verseline>
<verseline>In his own course</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Vengeance! plague! death! confusion! </verseline>
<verseline>Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Well, my good lord, I have inform&#8217;d them so</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Inform&#8217;d them? Dost thou understand me, man? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Ay, my good lord</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father </verseline>
<verseline>Would with his daughter speak, commands her service</verseline>
<verseline>Are they inform&#8217;d of this? My breath and blood! </verseline>
<verseline>Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that- </verseline>
<verseline>No, but not yet! May be he is not well</verseline>
<verseline>Infirmity doth still neglect all office </verseline>
<verseline>Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves </verseline>
<verseline>When nature, being oppress&#8217;d, commands the mind </verseline>
<verseline>To suffer with the body. I&#8217;ll forbear; </verseline>
<verseline>And am fallen out with my more headier will, </verseline>
<verseline>To take the indispos&#8217;d and sickly fit </verseline>
<verseline>For the sound man.-Death on my state! Wherefore </verseline>
<verseline>Should be sit here? This act persuades me </verseline>
<verseline>That this remotion of the Duke and her </verseline>
<verseline>Is practice only. Give me my servant forth</verseline>
<verseline>Go tell the Duke and&#8217;s wife I&#8217;ld speak with them- </verseline>
<verseline>Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me, </verseline>
<verseline>Or at their chamber door I&#8217;ll beat the drum </verseline>
<verseline>Till it cry sleep to death</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>I would have all well betwixt you. <stage_directions_inline>Exit.</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down! </verseline>
<character>Fool</character>
<prose>Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put &#8216;em i&#8217; th&#8217; paste alive. She knapp&#8217;d em o&#8217; th&#8217; coxcombs with </prose>
<prose>a stick and cried &#8216;Down, wantons, down!&#8217; &#8216;Twas her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay</prose>
<stage_directions>Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants</stage_directions>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Good morrow to you both</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Hail to your Grace! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Kent here set at liberty</stage_directions>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>I am glad to see your Highness</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Regan, I think you are; I know what reason </verseline>
<verseline>I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad, </verseline>
<verseline>I would divorce me from thy mother&#8217;s tomb, </verseline>
<verseline>Sepulchring an adultress.<stage_directions_inline> [To Kent]</stage_directions_inline> O, are you free? </verseline>
<verseline>Some other time for that. -Beloved Regan, </verseline>
<verseline>Thy sister&#8217;s naught. O Regan, she hath tied </verseline>
<verseline>Sharp-tooth&#8217;d unkindness, like a vulture, here! </verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Lays his hand on his heart.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>I can scarce speak to thee. Thou&#8217;lt not believe </verseline>
<verseline>With how deprav&#8217;d a quality-O Regan! </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope </verseline>
<verseline>You less know how to value her desert </verseline>
<verseline>Than she to scant her duty</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Say, how is that? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>I cannot think my sister in the least </verseline>
<verseline>Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance </verseline>
<verseline>She have restrain&#8217;d the riots of your followers, </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end, </verseline>
<verseline>As clears her from all blame</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>My curses on her! </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>O, sir, you are old! </verseline>
<verseline>Nature in you stands on the very verge </verseline>
<verseline>Of her confine. You should be rul&#8217;d, and led </verseline>
<verseline>By some discretion that discerns your State </verseline>
<verseline>Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you </verseline>
<verseline>That to our sister you do make return; </verseline>
<verseline>Say you have wrong&#8217;d her, sir</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Ask her forgiveness? </verseline>
<verseline>Do you but mark how this becomes the house: </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.<stage_directions_inline> [Kneels.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg </verseline>
<verseline>That you&#8217;ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.&#8217; </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks</verseline>
<verseline>Return you to my sister</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[rises]</stage_directions_inline> Never, Regan! </verseline>
<verseline>She hath abated me of half my train; </verseline>
<verseline>Look&#8217;d black upon me; struck me with her tongue, </verseline>
<verseline>Most serpent-like, upon the very heart</verseline>
<verseline>All the stor&#8217;d vengeances of heaven fall </verseline>
<verseline>On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones, </verseline>
<verseline>You taking airs, with lameness! </verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Fie, sir, fie! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames </verseline>
<verseline>Into her scornful eves! Infect her beauty, </verseline>
<verseline>You fen-suck&#8217;d fogs, drawn by the pow&#8217;rful sun, </verseline>
<verseline>To fall and blast her pride! </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>O the blest gods! so will you wish on me </verseline>
<verseline>When the rash mood is on</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse</verseline>
<verseline>Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give </verseline>
<verseline>Thee o&#8217;er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine </verseline>
<verseline>Do comfort, and not burn. &#8216;Tis not in thee </verseline>
<verseline>To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train, </verseline>
<verseline>To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes, </verseline>
<verseline>And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt </verseline>
<verseline>Against my coming in. Thou better know&#8217;st </verseline>
<verseline>The offices of nature, bond of childhood, </verseline>
<verseline>Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude</verseline>
<verseline>Thy half o&#8217; th&#8217; kingdom hast thou not forgot, </verseline>
<verseline>Wherein I thee endow&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Good sir, to th&#8217; purpose</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>Tucket within.</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Who put my man i&#8217; th&#8217; stocks? </verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>What trumpet&#8217;s that? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>I know&#8217;t--my sister&#8217;s. This approves her letter, </verseline>
<verseline>That she would soon be here</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter [Oswald the] Steward</stage_directions>
<verseline>Is your lady come? </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride </verseline>
<verseline>Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows</verseline>
<verseline>Out, varlet, from my sight! </verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>What means your Grace? </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Goneril</stage_directions>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Who stock&#8217;d my servant? Regan, I have good hope </verseline>
<verseline>Thou didst not know on&#8217;t.-Who comes here? O heavens! </verseline>
<verseline>If you do love old men, if your sweet sway </verseline>
<verseline>Allow obedience-if yourselves are old, </verseline>
<verseline>Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part! </verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[To Goneril]</stage_directions_inline> Art not asham&#8217;d to look upon this beard? - </verseline>
<verseline>O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand? </verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Why not by th&#8217; hand, sir? How have I offended? </verseline>
<verseline>All&#8217;s not offence that indiscretion finds </verseline>
<verseline>And dotage terms so</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>O sides, you are too tough! </verseline>
<verseline>Will you yet hold? How came my man i&#8217; th&#8217; stocks? </verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>I set him there, sir; but his own disorders </verseline>
<verseline>Deserv&#8217;d much less advancement</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>You? Did you? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>I pray you, father, being weak, seem so</verseline>
<verseline>If, till the expiration of your month, </verseline>
<verseline>You will return and sojourn with my sister, </verseline>
<verseline>Dismissing half your train, come then to me</verseline>
<verseline>I am now from home, and out of that provision </verseline>
<verseline>Which shall be needful for your entertainment</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Return to her, and fifty men dismiss&#8217;d? </verseline>
<verseline>No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose </verseline>
<verseline>To wage against the enmity o&#8217; th&#8217; air, </verseline>
<verseline>To be a comrade with the wolf and owl- </verseline>
<verseline>Necessity&#8217;s sharp pinch! Return with her? </verseline>
<verseline>Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took </verseline>
<verseline>Our youngest born, I could as well be brought </verseline>
<verseline>To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg </verseline>
<verseline>To keep base life afoot. Return with her? </verseline>
<verseline>Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter </verseline>
<verseline>To this detested groom. <stage_directions_inline>[Points at Oswald.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>At your choice, sir</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad</verseline>
<verseline>I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell</verseline>
<verseline>We&#8217;ll no more meet, no more see one another</verseline>
<verseline>But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter; </verseline>
<verseline>Or rather a disease that&#8217;s in my flesh, </verseline>
<verseline>Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil, </verseline>
<verseline>A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle </verseline>
<verseline>In my corrupted blood. But I&#8217;ll not chide thee</verseline>
<verseline>Let shame come when it will, I do not call it</verseline>
<verseline>I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot </verseline>
<verseline>Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove</verseline>
<verseline>Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure; </verseline>
<verseline>I can be patient, I can stay with Regan, </verseline>
<verseline>I and my hundred knights</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Not altogether so</verseline>
<verseline>I look&#8217;d not for you yet, nor am provided </verseline>
<verseline>For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister; </verseline>
<verseline>For those that mingle reason with your passion </verseline>
<verseline>Must be content to think you old, and so- </verseline>
<verseline>But she knows what she does</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Is this well spoken? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers? </verseline>
<verseline>Is it not well? What should you need of more? </verseline>
<verseline>Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger </verseline>
<verseline>Speak &#8216;gainst so great a number? How in one house </verseline>
<verseline>Should many people, under two commands, </verseline>
<verseline>Hold amity? &#8216;Tis hard; almost impossible</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance </verseline>
<verseline>From those that she calls servants, or from mine? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Why not, my lord? If then they chanc&#8217;d to slack ye, </verseline>
<verseline>We could control them. If you will come to me </verseline>
<verseline>(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you </verseline>
<verseline>To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more </verseline>
<verseline>Will I give place or notice</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>I gave you all- </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>And in good time you gave it! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Made you my guardians, my depositaries; </verseline>
<verseline>But kept a reservation to be followed </verseline>
<verseline>With such a number. What, must I come to you </verseline>
<verseline>With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>And speak&#8217;t again my lord. No more with me</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>When others are more wicked; not being the worst </verseline>
<verseline>Stands in some rank of praise.<stage_directions_inline> [To Goneril]</stage_directions_inline> I&#8217;ll go with thee</verseline>
<verseline>Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty, </verseline>
<verseline>And thou art twice her love</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Hear, me, my lord</verseline>
<verseline>What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five, </verseline>
<verseline>To follow in a house where twice so many </verseline>
<verseline>Have a command to tend you? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>What need one? </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars </verseline>
<verseline>Are in the poorest thing superfluous</verseline>
<verseline>Allow not nature more than nature needs, </verseline>
<verseline>Man&#8217;s life is cheap as beast&#8217;s. Thou art a lady: </verseline>
<verseline>If only to go warm were gorgeous, </verseline>
<verseline>Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear&#8217;st </verseline>
<verseline>Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need- </verseline>
<verseline>You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need! </verseline>
<verseline>You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, </verseline>
<verseline>As full of grief as age; wretched in both</verseline>
<verseline>If it he you that stirs these daughters&#8217; hearts </verseline>
<verseline>Against their father, fool me not so much </verseline>
<verseline>To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger, </verseline>
<verseline>And let not women&#8217;s weapons, water drops, </verseline>
<verseline>Stain my man&#8217;s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags! </verseline>
<verseline>I will have such revenges on you both </verseline>
<verseline>That all the world shall-I will do such things- </verseline>
<verseline>What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be </verseline>
<verseline>The terrors of the earth! You think I&#8217;ll weep</verseline>
<verseline>No, I&#8217;ll not weep</verseline>
<verseline>I have full cause of weeping, but this heart </verseline>
<verseline>Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws </verseline>
<verseline>Or ere I&#8217;ll weep. O fool, I shall go mad! </verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>

<stage_directions>Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and tempest</stage_directions>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Let us withdraw; &#8216;twill be a storm</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>This house is little; the old man and&#8217;s people </verseline>
<verseline>Cannot be well bestow&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest </verseline>
<verseline>And must needs taste his folly</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>For his particular, I&#8217;ll receive him gladly, </verseline>
<verseline>But not one follower</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>So am I purpos&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>Where is my Lord of Gloucester? </verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Followed the old man forth</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Gloucester</stage_directions>
<verseline>He is return&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>The King is in high rage</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Whither is he going? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>He calls to horse, but will I know not whither</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis best to give him way; he leads himself</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>My lord, entreat him by no means to stay</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds </verseline>
<verseline>Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about </verseline>
<verseline>There&#8217;s scarce a bush</verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>O, sir, to wilful men </verseline>
<verseline>The injuries that they themselves procure </verseline>
<verseline>Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors</verseline>
<verseline>He is attended with a desperate train, </verseline>
<verseline>And what they may incense him to, being apt </verseline>
<verseline>To have his ear abus&#8217;d, wisdom bids fear</verseline>
<character>Cornwall</character>
<verseline>Shut up your doors, my lord: &#8216;tis a wild night</verseline>
<verseline>My Regan counsels well. Come out o&#8217; th&#8217; storm</verseline>
<stage_directions>[Exeunt.] </stage_directions>
<act>Act III</act>
<firstscene>Scene I</firstscene>
<location>A heath</location>
<stage_directions>Storm still. Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors</stage_directions>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Who&#8217;s there, besides foul weather? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>One minded like the weather</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>I know you. Where&#8217;s the King? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Contending with the fretful elements </verseline>
<verseline>Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea, </verseline>
<verseline>Or swell the curled waters &#8216;bove the main, </verseline>
<verseline>That things might change or cease; tears his white hair, </verseline>
<verseline>Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage, </verseline>
<verseline>Catch in their fury and make nothing of; </verseline>
<verseline>Strives in his little world of man to outscorn </verseline>
<verseline>The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain</verseline>
<verseline>This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, </verseline>
<verseline>The lion and the belly-pinched wolf </verseline>
<verseline>Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs, </verseline>
<verseline>And bids what will take all</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>But who is with him? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>None but the fool, who labours to outjest </verseline>
<verseline>His heart-struck injuries</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Sir, I do know you, </verseline>
<verseline>And dare upon the warrant of my note </verseline>
<verseline>Commend a dear thing to you. There is division </verseline>
<verseline>(Although as yet the face of it be cover&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>With mutual cunning) &#8216;twixt Albany and Cornwall; </verseline>
<verseline>Who have (as who have not, that their great stars </verseline>
<verseline>Thron&#8217;d and set high?) servants, who seem no less, </verseline>
<verseline>Which are to France the spies and speculations </verseline>
<verseline>Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen, </verseline>
<verseline>Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes, </verseline>
<verseline>Or the hard rein which both of them have borne </verseline>
<verseline>Against the old kind King, or something deeper, </verseline>
<verseline>Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings- </verseline>
<verseline>But, true it is, from France there comes a power </verseline>
<verseline>Into this scattered kingdom, who already, </verseline>
<verseline>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet </verseline>
<verseline>In some of our best ports and are at point </verseline>
<verseline>To show their open banner. Now to you: </verseline>
<verseline>If on my credit you dare build so far </verseline>
<verseline>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find </verseline>
<verseline>Some that will thank you, making just report </verseline>
<verseline>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow </verseline>
<verseline>The King hath cause to plain</verseline>
<verseline>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding, </verseline>
<verseline>And from some knowledge and assurance offer </verseline>
<verseline>This office to you</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>I will talk further with you</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>No, do not</verseline>
<verseline>For confirmation that I am much more </verseline>
<verseline>Than my out-wall, open this purse and take </verseline>
<verseline>What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia </verseline>
<verseline>(As fear not but you shall), show her this ring, </verseline>
<verseline>And she will tell you who your fellow is </verseline>
<verseline>That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm! </verseline>
<verseline>I will go seek the King</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Give me your hand. Have you no more to say? </verseline>

<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband </verseline>
<verseline>Not met us on the way</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter [Oswald the] Steward</stage_directions>
<verseline>Now, where&#8217;s your master? </verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>Madam, within, but never man so chang&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>I told him of the army that was landed: </verseline>
<verseline>He smil&#8217;d at it. I told him you were coming: </verseline>
<verseline>His answer was, &#8216;The worse.&#8217; Of Gloucester&#8217;s treachery </verseline>
<verseline>And of the loyal service of his son </verseline>
<verseline>When I inform&#8217;d him, then be call&#8217;d me sot </verseline>
<verseline>And told me I had turn&#8217;d the wrong side out</verseline>
<verseline>What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him; </verseline>
<verseline>What like, offensive</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[to Edmund]</stage_directions_inline> Then shall you go no further</verseline>
<verseline>It is the cowish terror of his spirit, </verseline>
<verseline>That dares not undertake. He&#8217;ll not feel wrongs </verseline>
<verseline>Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way </verseline>
<verseline>May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother</verseline>
<verseline>Hasten his musters and conduct his pow&#8217;rs</verseline>
<verseline>I must change arms at home and give the distaff </verseline>
<verseline>Into my husband&#8217;s hands. This trusty servant </verseline>
<verseline>Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear </verseline>
<verseline>(If you dare venture in your own behalf) </verseline>
<verseline>A mistress&#8217;s command. Wear this.<stage_directions_inline>[Gives a favour.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>Spare speech</verseline>
<verseline>Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak, </verseline>
<verseline>Would stretch thy spirits up into the air</verseline>
<verseline>Conceive, and fare thee well</verseline>

<verseline>My most dear Gloucester! </verseline>
<verseline>O, the difference of man and man! </verseline>
<verseline>To thee a woman&#8217;s services are due; </verseline>

<stage_directions>Enter Albany</stage_directions>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>I have been worth the whistle</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>O Goneril, </verseline>
<verseline>You are not worth the dust which the rude wind </verseline>
<verseline>Blows in your face! I fear your disposition</verseline>
<verseline>That nature which contemns it origin </verseline>
<verseline>Cannot be bordered certain in itself</verseline>
<verseline>She that herself will sliver and disbranch </verseline>
<verseline>From her material sap, perforce must wither </verseline>
<verseline>And come to deadly use</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>No more! The text is foolish</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile; </verseline>
<verseline>Filths savour but themselves. What have you done? </verseline>
<verseline>Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform&#8217;d? </verseline>
<verseline>A father, and a gracious aged man, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose reverence even the head-lugg&#8217;d bear would lick, </verseline>
<verseline>Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded</verseline>
<verseline>Could my good brother stiffer you to do it? </verseline>
<verseline>A man, a prince, by him so benefited! </verseline>
<verseline>If that the heavens do not their visible spirits </verseline>
<verseline>Send quickly down to tame these vile offences, </verseline>
<verseline>It will come, </verseline>
<verseline>Humanity must perforce prey on itself, </verseline>
<verseline>Like monsters of the deep- </verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Milk-liver&#8217;d man! </verseline>
<verseline>That bear&#8217;st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs; </verseline>
<verseline>Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning </verseline>
<verseline>Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know&#8217;st </verseline>
<verseline>Fools do those villains pity who are punish&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>Ere they have done their mischief. Where&#8217;s thy drum? </verseline>
<verseline>France spreads his banners in our noiseless land, </verseline>
<verseline>With plumed helm thy state begins to threat, </verseline>
<verseline>Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit&#8217;st still, and criest </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Alack, why does he so?&#8217; </verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>See thyself, devil! </verseline>
<verseline>Proper deformity seems not in the fiend </verseline>

<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>O vain fool! </verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Thou changed and self-cover&#8217;d thing, for shame! </verseline>
<verseline>Bemonster not thy feature! Were&#8217;t my fitness </verseline>
<verseline>To let these hands obey my blood, </verseline>
<verseline>They are apt enough to dislocate and tear </verseline>
<verseline>Thy flesh and bones. Howe&#8217;er thou art a fiend, </verseline>

<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>What news? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall is dead, </verseline>
<verseline>Slain by his servant, going to put out </verseline>
<verseline>The other eye of Gloucester</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Gloucester&#8217;s eyes? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>A servant that he bred, thrill&#8217;d with remorse, </verseline>
<verseline>Oppos&#8217;d against the act, bending his sword </verseline>
<verseline>To his great master; who, thereat enrag&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>Flew on him, and amongst them fell&#8217;d him dead; </verseline>
<verseline>But not without that harmful stroke which since </verseline>
<verseline>Hath pluck&#8217;d him after</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>This shows you are above, </verseline>
<verseline>You justicers, that these our nether crimes </verseline>
<verseline>So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester! </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Both, both, my lord</verseline>
<verseline>This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer</verseline>

<verseline>No, my good lord; I met him back again</verseline>

<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Ay, my good lord. &#8216;Twas he inform&#8217;d against him, </verseline>

<verseline>Might have the freer course</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>

<scene>Scene III</scene>
<location>The French camp near Dover</location>
<stage_directions>Enter Kent and a Gentleman</stage_directions>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason? </prose>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<prose>Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary</prose>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Who hath he left behind him general? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<prose>Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of grief? </prose>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence, </verseline>
<verseline>And now and then an ample tear trill&#8217;d down </verseline>
<verseline>Her delicate cheek. It seem&#8217;d she was a queen </verseline>
<verseline>Over her passion, who, most rebel-like, </verseline>
<verseline>Sought to be king o&#8217;er her</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>O, then it mov&#8217;d her? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove </verseline>
<verseline>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen </verseline>
<verseline>Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears </verseline>
<verseline>Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets </verseline>
<verseline>That play&#8217;d on her ripe lip seem&#8217;d not to know </verseline>
<verseline>What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence </verseline>
<verseline>As pearls from diamonds dropp&#8217;d. In brief, </verseline>
<verseline>Sorrow would be a rarity most belov&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>If all could so become it</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Made she no verbal question? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Faith, once or twice she heav&#8217;d the name of father </verseline>
<verseline>Pantingly forth, as if it press&#8217;d her heart; </verseline>
<verseline>Cried &#8216;Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters! </verseline>
<verseline>Kent! father! sisters! What, i&#8217; th&#8217; storm? i&#8217; th&#8217; night? </verseline>
<verseline>Let pity not be believ&#8217;d!&#8217; There she shook </verseline>
<verseline>The holy water from her heavenly eyes, </verseline>
<verseline>And clamour moisten&#8217;d. Then away she started </verseline>
<verseline>To deal with grief alone</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>It is the stars, </verseline>
<verseline>The stars above us, govern our conditions; </verseline>
<verseline>Else one self mate and mate could not beget </verseline>
<verseline>Such different issues. You spoke not with her since? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>No</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Was this before the King return&#8217;d? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>No, since</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear&#8217;s i&#8217; th&#8217; town; </verseline>
<verseline>Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers </verseline>
<verseline>What we are come about, and by no means </verseline>
<verseline>Will yield to see his daughter</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Why, good sir? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness, </verseline>
<verseline>That stripp&#8217;d her from his benediction, turn&#8217;d her </verseline>
<verseline>To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights </verseline>
<verseline>To his dog-hearted daughters-these things sting </verseline>
<verseline>His mind so venomously that burning shame </verseline>
<verseline>Detains him from Cordelia</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Alack, poor gentleman! </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Of Albany&#8217;s and Cornwall&#8217;s powers you heard not? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis so; they are afoot</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Well, sir, I&#8217;ll bring you to our master Lear </verseline>

<verseline>Will in concealment wrap me up awhile</verseline>
<verseline>When I am known aright, you shall not grieve </verseline>

<verseline>Ay, madam</verseline>

<verseline>Madam, with much ado</verseline>
<verseline>Your sister is the better soldier</verseline>

<verseline>Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home? </verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>No, madam</verseline>

<verseline>What might import my sister&#8217;s letter to him? </verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>I know not, lady- </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter</verseline>
<verseline>It was great ignorance, Gloucester&#8217;s eyes being out, </verseline>
<verseline>To let him live. Where he arrives he moves </verseline>
<verseline>All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone, </verseline>
<verseline>In pity of his misery, to dispatch </verseline>
<verseline>His nighted life; moreover, to descry </verseline>

<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>I may not, madam</verseline>
<verseline>My lady charg&#8217;d my duty in this business</verseline>

<verseline>Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you </verseline>

<verseline>Madam, I had rather- </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>I know your lady does not love her husband; </verseline>
<verseline>I am sure of that; and at her late being here </verseline>
<verseline>She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks </verseline>
<verseline>To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom</verseline>
<character>Oswald</character>
<verseline>I, madam? </verseline>
<character>Regan</character>
<verseline>I speak in understanding. Y&#8217;are! I know&#8217;t</verseline>

<verseline>My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk&#8217;d, </verseline>

<verseline>You do climb up it now. Look how we labour</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Methinks the ground is even</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Horrible steep</verseline>
<verseline>Hark, do you hear the sea? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>No, truly</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect </verseline>
<verseline>By your eyes&#8217; anguish</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>So may it be indeed</verseline>
<verseline>Methinks thy voice is alter&#8217;d, and thou speak&#8217;st </verseline>
<verseline>In better phrase and matter than thou didst</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Y&#8217;are much deceiv&#8217;d. In nothing am I chang&#8217;d </verseline>

<verseline>Methinks y&#8217;are better spoken</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Come on, sir; here&#8217;s the place. Stand still. How fearful </verseline>
<verseline>And dizzy &#8216;tis to cast one&#8217;s eyes so low! </verseline>
<verseline>The crows and choughs that wing the midway air </verseline>
<verseline>Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down </verseline>
<verseline>Hangs one that gathers sampire-dreadful trade! </verseline>
<verseline>Methinks he seems no bigger than his head</verseline>
<verseline>The fishermen that walk upon the beach </verseline>
<verseline>Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark, </verseline>
<verseline>Diminish&#8217;d to her cock; her cock, a buoy </verseline>
<verseline>Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge </verseline>
<verseline>That on th&#8217; unnumb&#8217;red idle pebble chafes </verseline>
<verseline>Cannot be heard so high. I&#8217;ll look no more, </verseline>

<verseline>Topple down headlong</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Set me where you stand</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Give me your hand. You are now within a foot </verseline>

<verseline>Let go my hand</verseline>
<verseline>Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel </verseline>

<verseline>Gone, sir, farewell.- </verseline>

<verseline>Ten masts at each make not the altitude </verseline>
<verseline>Which thou hast perpendicularly fell</verseline>
<verseline>Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>But have I fall&#8217;n, or no? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>From the dread summit of this chalky bourn</verseline>
<verseline>Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg&#8217;d lark so far </verseline>
<verseline>Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Alack, I have no eyes! </verseline>
<verseline>Is wretchedness depriv&#8217;d that benefit </verseline>
<verseline>To end itself by death? &#8216;Twas yet some comfort </verseline>
<verseline>When misery could beguile the tyrant&#8217;s rage </verseline>
<verseline>And frustrate his proud will</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Give me your arm</verseline>
<verseline>Up-so. How is&#8217;t? Feel you your legs? You stand</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Too well, too well</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>This is above all strangeness</verseline>
<verseline>Upon the crown o&#8217; th&#8217; cliff what thing was that </verseline>
<verseline>Which parted from you? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>A poor unfortunate beggar</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>As I stood here below, methought his eyes </verseline>
<verseline>Were two full moon,; he had a thousand noses, </verseline>
<verseline>Horns whelk&#8217;d and wav&#8217;d like the enridged sea</verseline>
<verseline>It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father, </verseline>
<verseline>Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours </verseline>
<verseline>Of men&#8217;s impossibility, have preserv&#8217;d thee</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>I do remember now. Henceforth I&#8217;ll bear </verseline>
<verseline>Affliction till it do cry out itself </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Enough, enough,&#8217; and die. That thing you speak of, </verseline>
<verseline>I took it for a man. Often &#8216;twould say </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;The fiend, the fiend&#8217;-he led me to that place</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Bear free and patient thoughts</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds]</stage_directions>
<verseline>But who comes here? </verseline>
<verseline>The safer sense will ne&#8217;er accommodate </verseline>
<verseline>His master thus</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>No, they cannot touch me for coming; </verseline>
<verseline>I am the King himself</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>O thou side-piercing sight! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<prose>Nature is above art in that respect. There&#8217;s your press money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw me </prose>
<prose>a clothier&#8217;s yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted cheese will do&#8217;t. There&#8217;s my gauntlet; I&#8217;ll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i&#8217; th&#8217; clout, i&#8217; th&#8217; clout! Hewgh! Give the word</prose>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Sweet marjoram</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Pass</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>I know that voice</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<prose>Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter&#8217;d me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say &#8216;ay&#8217; and &#8216;no&#8217; to everything I said! &#8216;Ay&#8217; and </prose>
<prose>&#8216;no&#8217; too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found &#8216;em, there I smelt &#8216;em out. Go to, they are not men o&#8217; their words! They told me I was everything. &#8216;Tis a lie-I am not ague-proof</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>The trick of that voice I do well remember</verseline>
<verseline>Is&#8217;t not the King? </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Ay, every inch a king! </verseline>
<verseline>When I do stare, see how the subject quakes</verseline>
<verseline>I pardon that man&#8217;s life. What was thy cause? </verseline>
<verseline>Adultery? </verseline>
<verseline>Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No</verseline>
<verseline>The wren goes to&#8217;t, and the small gilded fly </verseline>
<verseline>Does lecher in my sight</verseline>
<verseline>Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester&#8217;s bastard son </verseline>
<verseline>Was kinder to his father than my daughters </verseline>
<verseline>Got &#8216;tween the lawful sheets</verseline>
<verseline>To&#8217;t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers</verseline>
<verseline>Behold yond simp&#8217;ring dame, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose face between her forks presageth snow, </verseline>
<verseline>That minces virtue, and does shake the head </verseline>
<verseline>To hear of pleasure&#8217;s name</verseline>
<verseline>The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to&#8217;t </verseline>
<verseline>With a more riotous appetite</verseline>
<verseline>Down from the waist they are Centaurs, </verseline>
<verseline>Though women all above</verseline>
<verseline>But to the girdle do the gods inherit, </verseline>
<verseline>Beneath is all the fiend&#8217;s</verseline>
<prose>There&#8217;s hell, there&#8217;s darkness, there&#8217;s the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! </prose>
<prose>Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination. There&#8217;s money for thee</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>O, let me kiss that hand! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>O ruin&#8217;d piece of nature! This great world </verseline>
<verseline>Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me? </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me? </verseline>
<prose>No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I&#8217;ll not love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Were all the letters suns, I could not see one</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[aside]</stage_directions_inline> I would not take this from report. It is, </verseline>
<verseline>And my heart breaks at it</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Read</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>What, with the case of eyes? </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<prose>O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light. Yet you see how this world goes</prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>I see it feelingly</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes</verseline>
<prose>Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer&#8217;s dog bark at a beggar? </prose>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Ay, sir</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<prose>And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog&#8217;s obeyed in office</prose>
<verseline>Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand! </verseline>
<verseline>Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back</verseline>
<verseline>Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind </verseline>
<verseline>For which thou whip&#8217;st her. The usurer hangs the cozener</verseline>
<verseline>Through tatter&#8217;d clothes small vices do appear; </verseline>
<verseline>Robes and furr&#8217;d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, </verseline>
<verseline>And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks; </verseline>
<verseline>Arm it in rags, a pygmy&#8217;s straw does pierce it</verseline>
<verseline>None does offend, none-I say none! I&#8217;ll able &#8216;em</verseline>
<verseline>Take that of me, my friend, who have the power </verseline>
<verseline>To seal th&#8217; accuser&#8217;s lips. Get thee glass eyes </verseline>
<verseline>And, like a scurvy politician, seem </verseline>
<verseline>To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now! </verseline>
<verseline>Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>O, matter and impertinency mix&#8217;d! </verseline>
<verseline>Reason, in madness! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes</verseline>
<verseline>I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester</verseline>
<verseline>Thou must be patient. We came crying bother; </verseline>
<verseline>Thou know&#8217;st, the first time that we smell &#8216;the air </verseline>
<verseline>We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Alack, alack the day! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>When we are born, we cry that we are come </verseline>
<verseline>To this great stage of fools. This&#8217; a good block</verseline>
<verseline>It were a delicate stratagem to shoe </verseline>
<verseline>A troop of horse with felt. I&#8217;ll put&#8217;t in proof, </verseline>
<verseline>And when I have stol&#8217;n upon these sons-in-law, </verseline>
<verseline>Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants]</stage_directions>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.-Sir, </verseline>
<verseline>Your most dear daughter- </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even </verseline>
<verseline>The natural fool of fortune. Use me well; </verseline>
<verseline>You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon; </verseline>
<verseline>I am cut to th&#8217; brains</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>You shall have anything</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>No seconds? All myself? </verseline>
<verseline>Why, this would make a man a man of salt, </verseline>
<verseline>To use his eyes for garden waterpots, </verseline>
<verseline>Ay, and laying autumn&#8217;s dust</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Good sir- </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What! </verseline>
<verseline>I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king; </verseline>
<verseline>My masters, know you that? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>You are a royal one, and we obey you</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<prose>Then there&#8217;s life in&#8217;t. Nay, an you get it, you shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa! </prose>
<stage_directions>Exit running. [Attendants follow.] </stage_directions>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, </verseline>
<verseline>Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter </verseline>
<verseline>Who redeems nature from the general curse </verseline>
<verseline>Which twain have brought her to</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Hail, gentle sir</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Sir, speed you. What&#8217;s your will? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that </verseline>
<verseline>Which can distinguish sound</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>But, by your favour, </verseline>
<verseline>How near&#8217;s the other army? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Near and on speedy foot. The main descry </verseline>
<verseline>Stands on the hourly thought</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>I thank you sir. That&#8217;s all</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Though that the Queen on special cause is here, </verseline>

<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me; </verseline>
<verseline>Let not my worser spirit tempt me again </verseline>
<verseline>To die before you please! </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Well pray you, father</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Now, good sir, what are you? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>A most poor man, made tame to fortune&#8217;s blows, </verseline>
<verseline>Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows, </verseline>
<verseline>Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand; </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll lead you to some biding</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>Hearty thanks</verseline>
<verseline>The bounty and the benison of heaven </verseline>

<verseline>Upon the British party. O, untimely death! Death! He dies</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>I know thee well. A serviceable villain, </verseline>
<verseline>As duteous to the vices of thy mistress </verseline>
<verseline>As badness would desire</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>What, is he dead? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Sit you down, father; rest you</verseline>
<verseline>Let&#8217;s see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of </verseline>
<verseline>May be my friends. He&#8217;s dead. I am only sorry </verseline>
<verseline>He had no other deathsman. Let us see</verseline>
<verseline>Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not</verseline>
<verseline>To know our enemies&#8217; minds, we&#8217;ld rip their hearts; </verseline>

</verseline>
<prose>&#8216;Let our reciprocal vows be rememb&#8217;red. You have many opportunities to cut him off. If your will want not, time and place be fruitfully offer&#8217;d. There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my jail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labour</prose>

<verseline>That of thy death and business I can tell</verseline>
<character>Gloucester</character>
<verseline>The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense, </verseline>
<verseline>That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling </verseline>
<verseline>Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract</verseline>
<verseline>So should my thoughts be sever&#8217;d from my griefs, </verseline>

<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work </verseline>
<verseline>To match thy goodness? My life will be too short </verseline>
<verseline>And every measure fall me</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>To be acknowledg&#8217;d, madam, is o&#8217;erpaid</verseline>

<verseline>Nor more nor clipp&#8217;d, but so</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Be better suited</verseline>
<verseline>These weeds are memories of those worser hours</verseline>
<verseline>I prithee put them off</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Pardon, dear madam</verseline>
<verseline>Yet to be known shortens my made intent</verseline>
<verseline>My boon I make it that you know me not </verseline>

<verseline>Then be&#8217;t so, my good lord.<stage_directions_inline> [To the Doctor]</stage_directions_inline> How, does the King? </verseline>

<verseline>Kind and dear princess! </verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Had you not been their father, these white flakes </verseline>
<verseline>Had challeng&#8217;d pity of them. Was this a face </verseline>
<verseline>To be oppos&#8217;d against the warring winds? </verseline>
<verseline>To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder? </verseline>
<verseline>In the most terrible and nimble stroke </verseline>
<verseline>Of quick cross lightning? to watch-poor perdu!- </verseline>
<verseline>With this thin helm? Mine enemy&#8217;s dog, </verseline>
<verseline>Though he had bit me, should have stood that night </verseline>
<verseline>Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father, </verseline>
<verseline>To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn, </verseline>
<verseline>In short and musty straw? Alack, alack! </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once </verseline>
<verseline>Had not concluded all.-He wakes. Speak to him</verseline>
<character>Doctor</character>
<verseline>Madam, do you; &#8216;tis fittest</verseline>
<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty? </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>You do me wrong to take me out o&#8217; th&#8217; grave</verseline>
<verseline>Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound </verseline>

<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>Sir, do you know me? </verseline>

<verseline>You are a spirit, I know. When did you die? </verseline>

<verseline>Still, still, far wide! </verseline>
<character>Doctor</character>
<verseline>He&#8217;s scarce awake. Let him alone awhile</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight, </verseline>
<verseline>I am mightily abus&#8217;d. I should e&#8217;en die with pity, </verseline>
<verseline>To see another thus. I know not what to say</verseline>
<verseline>I will not swear these are my hands. Let&#8217;s see</verseline>
<verseline>I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur&#8217;d </verseline>

<character>Cordelia</character>
<verseline>O, look upon me, sir, </verseline>
<verseline>And hold your hands in benediction o&#8217;er me</verseline>
<verseline>No, sir, you must not kneel</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Pray, do not mock me</verseline>
<verseline>I am a very foolish fond old man, </verseline>
<verseline>Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less; </verseline>
<verseline>And, to deal plainly, </verseline>
<verseline>I fear I am not in my perfect mind</verseline>
<verseline>Methinks I should know you, and know this man; </verseline>
<verseline>Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant </verseline>
<verseline>What place this is; and all the skill I have </verseline>
<verseline>Remembers not these garments; nor I know not </verseline>

<verseline>Sir, you have show&#8217;d to-day your valiant strain, </verseline>

<verseline>As we shall find their merits and our safety </verseline>
<verseline>May equally determine</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Sir, I thought it fit </verseline>
<verseline>To send the old and miserable King </verseline>
<verseline>To some retention and a pointed guard; </verseline>
<verseline>Whose age has charms in it, whose title more, </verseline>
<verseline>To pluck the common bosom on his side </verseline>
<verseline>And turn our impress&#8217;d lances in our eyes </verseline>
<verseline>Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen, </verseline>
<verseline>My reason all the same; and they are ready </verseline>
<verseline>To-morrow, or at further space, t&#8217; appear </verseline>
<verseline>Where you shall hold your session. At this time </verseline>

<verseline>Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence, </verseline>
<verseline>Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune, </verseline>
<verseline>Thy valour and thy heart-thou art a traitor; </verseline>
<verseline>False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father; </verseline>
<verseline>Conspirant &#8216;gainst this high illustrious prince; </verseline>
<verseline>And from th&#8217; extremest upward of thy head </verseline>

<verseline>Back do I toss those treasons to thy head; </verseline>
<verseline>With the hell-hated lie o&#8217;erwhelm thy heart; </verseline>
<verseline>Which-for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise- </verseline>
<verseline>This sword of mine shall give them instant way </verseline>

<stage_directions_inline>To Goneril]</stage_directions_inline> Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil</verseline>
<verseline>No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it</verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Say if I do-the laws are mine, not thine</verseline>
<verseline>Who can arraign me fort? </verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Most monstrous! </verseline>
<verseline>Know&#8217;st thou this paper? </verseline>
<character>Goneril</character>
<verseline>Ask me not what I know. <stage_directions_inline>Exit.</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Go after her. She&#8217;s desperate; govern her</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Exit an Officer.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>What, you have charg&#8217;d me with, that have I done, </verseline>
<verseline>And more, much more. The time will bring it out</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis past, and so am I.-But what art thou </verseline>
<verseline>That hast this fortune on me? If thou&#8217;rt noble, </verseline>
<verseline>I do forgive thee</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Let&#8217;s exchange charity</verseline>
<verseline>I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund; </verseline>
<verseline>If more, the more th&#8217; hast wrong&#8217;d me</verseline>
<verseline>My name is Edgar and thy father&#8217;s son</verseline>
<verseline>The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices </verseline>
<verseline>Make instruments to scourge us</verseline>
<verseline>The dark and vicious place where thee he got </verseline>
<verseline>Cost him his eyes</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Th&#8217; hast spoken right; &#8216;tis true</verseline>
<verseline>The wheel is come full circle; I am here</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Methought thy very gait did prophesy </verseline>
<verseline>A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee</verseline>
<verseline>Let sorrow split my heart if ever I </verseline>
<verseline>Did hate thee, or thy father! </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Worthy prince, I know&#8217;t</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Where have you hid yourself? </verseline>
<verseline>How have you known the miseries of your father? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale; </verseline>
<verseline>And when &#8216;tis told, O that my heart would burst! </verseline>
<verseline>The bloody proclamation to escape </verseline>
<verseline>That follow&#8217;d me so near (O, our lives&#8217; sweetness! </verseline>
<verseline>That with the pain of death would hourly die </verseline>
<verseline>Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift </verseline>
<verseline>Into a madman&#8217;s rags, t&#8217; assume a semblance </verseline>
<verseline>That very dogs disdain&#8217;d; and in this habit </verseline>
<verseline>Met I my father with his bleeding rings, </verseline>
<verseline>Their precious stones new lost; became his guide, </verseline>
<verseline>Led him, begg&#8217;d for him, sav&#8217;d him from despair; </verseline>
<verseline>Never (O fault!) reveal&#8217;d myself unto him </verseline>
<verseline>Until some half hour past, when I was arm&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>Not sure, though hoping of this good success, </verseline>
<verseline>I ask&#8217;d his blessing, and from first to last </verseline>
<verseline>Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw&#8217;d heart </verseline>
<verseline>(Alack, too weak the conflict to support!) </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, </verseline>
<verseline>Burst smilingly</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>This speech of yours hath mov&#8217;d me, </verseline>
<verseline>And shall perchance do good; but speak you on; </verseline>
<verseline>You look as you had something more to say</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>If there be more, more woful, hold it in; </verseline>
<verseline>For I am almost ready to dissolve, </verseline>
<verseline>Hearing of this</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>This would have seem&#8217;d a period </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;To such as love not sorrow; but another, </verseline>
<verseline>To amplify too much, would make much more, </verseline>
<verseline>And top extremity</verseline>
<verseline>Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man, </verseline>
<verseline>Who, having seen me in my worst estate, </verseline>
<verseline>Shunn&#8217;d my abhorr&#8217;d society; but then, finding </verseline>
<verseline>Who &#8216;twas that so endur&#8217;d, with his strong arms </verseline>
<verseline>He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out </verseline>
<verseline>As he&#8217;d burst heaven; threw him on my father; </verseline>
<verseline>Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him </verseline>
<verseline>That ever ear receiv&#8217;d; which in recounting </verseline>
<verseline>His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life </verseline>
<verseline>Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded, </verseline>
<verseline>And there I left him tranc&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>But who was this? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Kent, sir, the banish&#8217;d Kent; who in disguise </verseline>
<verseline>Followed his enemy king and did him service </verseline>
<verseline>Improper for a slave</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife</stage_directions>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Help, help! O, help! </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>What kind of help? </verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Speak, man</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>What means that bloody knife? </verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis hot, it smokes</verseline>
<verseline>It came even from the heart of-O! she&#8217;s dead! </verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Who dead? Speak, man</verseline>
<character>Gentleman</character>
<verseline>Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister </verseline>
<verseline>By her is poisoned; she hath confess&#8217;d it</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>I was contracted to them both. All three </verseline>
<verseline>Now marry in an instant</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Kent</stage_directions>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Here comes Kent</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Exit Gentleman.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble </verseline>
<verseline>Touches us not with pity. O, is this he? </verseline>
<verseline>The time will not allow the compliment </verseline>
<verseline>That very manners urges</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>I am come </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;To bid my king and master aye good night</verseline>
<verseline>Is he not here? </verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Great thing of us forgot! </verseline>
<verseline>Speak, Edmund, where&#8217;s the King? and where&#8217;s Cordelia? </verseline>
<stage_directions>The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in</stage_directions>
<verseline>Seest thou this object, Kent? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Alack, why thus? </verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Yet Edmund was belov&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>The one the other poisoned for my sake, </verseline>
<verseline>And after slew herself</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Even so. Cover their faces</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>I pant for life. Some good I mean to do, </verseline>
<verseline>Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send </verseline>
<verseline>(Be brief in&#8217;t) to the castle; for my writ </verseline>
<verseline>Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia</verseline>
<verseline>Nay, send in time</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Run, run, O, run! </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send </verseline>
<verseline>Thy token of reprieve</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>Well thought on. Take my sword; </verseline>
<verseline>Give it the Captain</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Haste thee for thy life. <stage_directions_inline>[Exit Edgar.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Edmund</character>
<verseline>He hath commission from thy wife and me </verseline>
<verseline>To hang Cordelia in the prison and </verseline>
<verseline>To lay the blame upon her own despair </verseline>
<verseline>That she fordid herself</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Edmund is borne off.]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Lear, with Cordelia [dead] in his arms, [Edgar, Captain, and others following]</stage_directions>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone</verseline>
<verseline>Had I your tongues and eyes, I&#8217;ld use them so </verseline>
<verseline>That heaven&#8217;s vault should crack. She&#8217;s gone for ever! </verseline>
<verseline>I know when one is dead, and when one lives</verseline>
<verseline>She&#8217;s dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass</verseline>
<verseline>If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, </verseline>
<verseline>Why, then she lives</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Is this the promis&#8217;d end? </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Or image of that horror? </verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Fall and cease! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so, </verseline>
<verseline>It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows </verseline>
<verseline>That ever I have felt</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>O my good master! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Prithee away! </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis noble Kent, your friend</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all! </verseline>
<verseline>I might have sav&#8217;d her; now she&#8217;s gone for ever! </verseline>
<verseline>Cordelia, Cordelia I stay a little. Ha! </verseline>
<verseline>What is&#8217;t thou say&#8217;st, Her voice was ever soft, </verseline>
<verseline>Gentle, and low-an excellent thing in woman</verseline>
<verseline>I kill&#8217;d the slave that was a-hanging thee</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis true, my lords, he did</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Did I not, fellow? </verseline>
<verseline>I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion </verseline>
<verseline>I would have made them skip. I am old now, </verseline>
<verseline>And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you? </verseline>
<verseline>Mine eyes are not o&#8217; th&#8217; best. I&#8217;ll tell you straight</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>If fortune brag of two she lov&#8217;d and hated, </verseline>
<verseline>One of them we behold</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>This&#8217; a dull sight. Are you not Kent? </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>The same- </verseline>
<verseline>Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius? </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>He&#8217;s a good fellow, I can tell you that</verseline>
<verseline>He&#8217;ll strike, and quickly too. He&#8217;s dead and rotten</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>No, my good lord; I am the very man- </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll see that straight</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>That from your first of difference and decay </verseline>
<verseline>Have followed your sad steps</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>You&#8217;re welcome hither</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Nor no man else! All&#8217;s cheerless, dark, and deadly</verseline>
<verseline>Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, </verseline>
<verseline>And desperately are dead</verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>Ay, so I think</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>He knows not what he says; and vain is it </verseline>
<verseline>That we present us to him</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Very bootless</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter a Captain</stage_directions>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>Edmund is dead, my lord</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>That&#8217;s but a trifle here</verseline>
<verseline>You lords and noble friends, know our intent</verseline>
<verseline>What comfort to this great decay may come </verseline>
<verseline>Shall be applied. For us, we will resign, </verseline>
<verseline>During the life of this old Majesty, </verseline>
<verseline>To him our absolute power;<stage_directions_inline> [to Edgar and Kent]</stage_directions_inline> you to your rights; </verseline>
<verseline>With boot, and Such addition as your honours </verseline>
<verseline>Have more than merited.-All friends shall taste </verseline>
<verseline>The wages of their virtue, and all foes </verseline>
<verseline>The cup of their deservings.-O, see, see! </verseline>
<character>Lear</character>
<verseline>And my poor fool is hang&#8217;d! No, no, no life! </verseline>
<verseline>Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life, </verseline>
<verseline>And thou no breath at all? Thou&#8217;lt come no more, </verseline>
<verseline>Never, never, never, never, never! </verseline>
<verseline>Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir</verseline>
<verseline>Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips! </verseline>
<verseline>Look there, look there! He dies</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>He faints! My lord, my lord! </verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Break, heart; I prithee break! </verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>Look up, my lord</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him </verseline>
<verseline>That would upon the rack of this tough world </verseline>
<verseline>Stretch him out longer</verseline>
<character>Edgar</character>
<verseline>He is gone indeed</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>The wonder is, he hath endur&#8217;d so long</verseline>
<verseline>He but usurp&#8217;d his life</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>Bear them from hence. Our present business </verseline>
<verseline>Is general woe.<stage_directions_inline> [To Kent and Edgar]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>Friends of my soul, you twain </verseline>
<verseline>Rule in this realm, and the gor&#8217;d state sustain</verseline>
<character>Kent</character>
<verseline>I have a journey, sir, shortly to go</verseline>
<verseline>My master calls me; I must not say no</verseline>
<character>Albany</character>
<verseline>The weight of this sad time we must obey, </verseline>
<verseline>Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say</verseline>
<verseline>The oldest have borne most; we that are young </verseline>
<verseline>Shall never see so much, nor live so long</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt with a dead march</stage_directions>
<verseline>-THE END- </verseline>
