<stage_directions>Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords;</stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Musicians attending</stage_directions>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>If music be the food of love, play on,</verseline>
<verseline>Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,</verseline>
<verseline>The appetite may sicken and so die</verseline>
<verseline>That strain again! It had a dying fall;</verseline>
<verseline>O, it came o&#8217;er my ear like the sweet sound</verseline>
<verseline>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</verseline>
<verseline>Stealing and giving odour! Enough, no more;</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis not so sweet now as it was before</verseline>
<verseline>O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!</verseline>
<verseline>That, notwithstanding thy capacity</verseline>
<verseline>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,</verseline>
<verseline>Of what validity and pitch soe&#8217;er,</verseline>
<verseline>But falls into abatement and low price</verseline>
<verseline>Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy,</verseline>
<verseline>That it alone is high fantastical</verseline>
<character>Curio</character>
<verseline>Will you go hunt, my lord?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>What, Curio?</verseline>
<character>Curio</character>
<verseline>The hart</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Why, so I do, the noblest that I have</verseline>
<verseline>O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,</verseline>
<verseline>Methought she purg&#8217;d the air of pestilence!</verseline>
<verseline>That instant was I turn&#8217;d into a hart,</verseline>
<verseline>And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,</verseline>
<verseline>E&#8217;er since pursue me</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Valentine</stage_directions>
<verseline>How now! what news from her?</verseline>
<character>Valentine</character>
<verseline>So please my lord, I might not be admitted,</verseline>
<verseline>But from her handmaid do return this answer:</verseline>
<verseline>The element itself, till seven years&#8217; heat,</verseline>
<verseline>Shall not behold her face at ample view;</verseline>
<verseline>But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,</verseline>
<verseline>And water once a day her chamber round</verseline>
<verseline>With eye-offending brine; all this to season</verseline>
<verseline>A brother&#8217;s dead love, which she would keep fresh</verseline>
<verseline>And lasting in her sad remembrance</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</verseline>
<verseline>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</verseline>
<verseline>How will she love when the rich golden shaft</verseline>
<verseline>Hath kill&#8217;d the flock of all affections else</verseline>
<verseline>That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,</verseline>
<verseline>These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill&#8217;d,</verseline>
<verseline>Her sweet perfections, with one self king!</verseline>
<verseline>Away before me to sweet beds of flow&#8217;rs:</verseline>
<verseline>Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bow&#8217;rs</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt</stage_directions>
<scene>Scene Ii</scene>
<location>The sea-coast</location>
<stage_directions>Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors</stage_directions>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>What country, friends, is this?</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>This is Illyria, lady</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>And what should I do in Illyria?</verseline>
<verseline>My brother he is in Elysium</verseline>
<verseline>Perchance he is not drown&#8217;d- what think you, sailors?</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>It is perchance that you yourself were saved</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>True, madam, and, to comfort you with chance,</verseline>
<verseline>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</verseline>
<verseline>When you, and those poor number saved with you,</verseline>
<verseline>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</verseline>
<verseline>Most provident in peril, bind himself-</verseline>
<verseline>Courage and hope both teaching him the practice-</verseline>
<verseline>To a strong mast that liv&#8217;d upon the sea;</verseline>
<verseline>Where, like Arion on the dolphin&#8217;s back,</verseline>
<verseline>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</verseline>
<verseline>So long as I could see</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>For saying so, there&#8217;s gold</verseline>
<verseline>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</verseline>
<verseline>Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</verseline>
<verseline>The like of him. Know&#8217;st thou this country?</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born</verseline>
<verseline>Not three hours&#8217; travel from this very place</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Who governs here?</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>A noble duke, in nature as in name</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>What is his name?</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>Orsino</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Orsino! I have heard my father name him</verseline>
<verseline>He was a bachelor then</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>And so is now, or was so very late;</verseline>
<verseline>For but a month ago I went from hence,</verseline>
<verseline>And then &#8216;twas fresh in murmur- as, you know,</verseline>
<verseline>What great ones do the less will prattle of-</verseline>
<verseline>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>What&#8217;s she?</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</verseline>
<verseline>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</verseline>
<verseline>In the protection of his son, her brother,</verseline>
<verseline>Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,</verseline>
<verseline>They say, she hath abjur&#8217;d the company</verseline>
<verseline>And sight of men</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>O that I serv&#8217;d that lady,</verseline>
<verseline>And might not be delivered to the world,</verseline>
<verseline>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,</verseline>
<verseline>What my estate is!</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>That were hard to compass,</verseline>
<verseline>Because she will admit no kind of suit-</verseline>
<verseline>No, not the Duke&#8217;s</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;</verseline>
<verseline>And though that nature with a beauteous wall</verseline>
<verseline>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</verseline>
<verseline>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</verseline>
<verseline>With this thy fair and outward character</verseline>
<verseline>I prithee, and I&#8217;ll pay thee bounteously,</verseline>
<verseline>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</verseline>
<verseline>For such disguise as haply shall become</verseline>
<verseline>The form of my intent. I&#8217;ll serve this duke:</verseline>
<verseline>Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him;</verseline>
<verseline>It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing</verseline>
<verseline>And speak to him in many sorts of music,</verseline>
<verseline>That will allow me very worth his service</verseline>
<verseline>What else may hap to time I will commit;</verseline>
<verseline>Only shape thou silence to my wit</verseline>
<character>Captain</character>
<verseline>Be you his eunuch and your mute I&#8217;ll be;</verseline>
<verseline>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I thank thee. Lead me on</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt</stage_directions>
<scene>Scene Iii</scene>
<location>Olivia&#8217;s house</location>
<stage_directions>Enter Sir Toby Belch and Maria</stage_directions>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care&#8217;s an enemy to life</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o&#8217; nights; your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Why, let her except before excepted</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Confine! I&#8217;ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>That quaffing and drinking will undo you; I heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Ay, he</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>He&#8217;s as tall a man as any&#8217;s in Illyria</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>What&#8217;s that to th&#8217; purpose?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Why, he has three thousand ducats a year</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Ay, but he&#8217;ll have but a year in all these ducats; he&#8217;s a very fool and a prodigal</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Fie that you&#8217;ll say so! He plays o&#8217; th&#8217; viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he&#8217;s a fool, he&#8217;s a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, &#8216;tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors that say so of him. Who are they?</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>They that add, moreover, he&#8217;s drunk nightly in your company</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>With drinking healths to my niece; I&#8217;ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.He&#8217;s a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o&#8217; th&#8217; toe like a parish-top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface</prose>
<stage_directions>Enter Sir Andrew Aguecheek</stage_directions>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Sweet Sir Andrew!</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Bless you, fair shrew</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>And you too, sir</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Accost, Sir Andrew, accost</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>What&#8217;s that?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>My niece&#8217;s chambermaid</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>My name is Mary, sir</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Good Mistress Mary Accost-</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby. </character>
<prose>You mistake, knight. &#8216;Accost&#8217; is front her, board her, woo her, assail her</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company</verseline>
<verseline>Is that the meaning of &#8216;accost&#8217;?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Fare you well, gentlemen</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again!</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Sir, I have not you by th&#8217; hand</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Marry, but you shall have; and here&#8217;s my hand</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th&#8217; buttry-bar and let it drink</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Wherefore, sweetheart? What&#8217;s your metaphor?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>It&#8217;s dry, sir</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what&#8217;s your jest?</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>A dry jest, sir</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Are you full of them?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers&#8217; ends; marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren</prose>
<stage_directions>Exit Maria</stage_directions>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>O knight, thou lack&#8217;st a cup of canary! When did I see thee so put down?</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>No question</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>An I thought that, I&#8217;d forswear it. I&#8217;ll ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Pourquoi, my dear knight?</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>What is &#8216;pourquoi&#8217;- do or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. Oh, had I but followed the arts!</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Why, would that have mended my hair?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>But it becomes me well enough, does&#8217;t not?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs and spin it off</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Faith, I&#8217;ll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it&#8217;s four to one she&#8217;ll none of me; the Count himself here hard by woos her</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>She&#8217;ll none o&#8217; th&#8217; Count; she&#8217;ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear&#8217;t. Tut, there&#8217;s life in&#8217;t, man</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>I&#8217;ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o&#8217; th&#8217; strangest mind i&#8217; th&#8217; world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Faith, I can cut a caper</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>And I can cut the mutton to&#8217;t</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before &#8216;em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall&#8217;s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form&#8217;d under the star of a galliard</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Ay, &#8216;tis strong, and it does indifferent well in flame-colour&#8217;d stock. Shall we set about some revels?</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Taurus? That&#8217;s sides and heart</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper. Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!</prose>
<stage_directions>Exeunt</stage_directions>

<location>The Duke&#8217;s palace</location>
<stage_directions>Enter Valentine, and Viola in man&#8217;s attire</stage_directions>
<character>Valentine</character>
<prose>If the Duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanc&#8217;d; he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?</prose>
<character>Valentine</character>
<verseline>No, believe me</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Duke, Curio, and Attendants</stage_directions>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I thank you. Here comes the Count</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Who saw Cesario, ho?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>On your attendance, my lord, here</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario,</verseline>
<verseline>Thou know&#8217;st no less but all; I have unclasp&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>To thee the book even of my secret soul</verseline>
<verseline>Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;</verseline>
<verseline>Be not denied access, stand at her doors,</verseline>
<verseline>And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow</verseline>
<verseline>Till thou have audience</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Sure, my noble lord,</verseline>
<verseline>If she be so abandon&#8217;d to her sorrow</verseline>
<verseline>As it is spoke, she never will admit me</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds,</verseline>
<verseline>Rather than make unprofited return</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>O, then unfold the passion of my love,</verseline>
<verseline>Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith!</verseline>
<verseline>It shall become thee well to act my woes:</verseline>
<verseline>She will attend it better in thy youth</verseline>
<verseline>Than in a nuncio&#8217;s of more grave aspect</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I think not so, my lord</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Dear lad, believe it,</verseline>
<verseline>For they shall yet belie thy happy years</verseline>
<verseline>That say thou art a man: Diana&#8217;s lip</verseline>
<verseline>Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe</verseline>
<verseline>Is as the maiden&#8217;s organ, shrill and sound,</verseline>
<verseline>And all is semblative a woman&#8217;s part</verseline>
<verseline>I know thy constellation is right apt</verseline>
<verseline>For this affair. Some four or five attend him-</verseline>
<verseline>All, if you will, for I myself am best</verseline>
<verseline>When least in company. Prosper well in this,</verseline>
<verseline>And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord</verseline>
<verseline>To call his fortunes thine</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll do my best</verseline>
<verseline>To woo your lady. </verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Aside]</stage_directions_inline> Yet, a barful strife!</verseline>
<verseline>Whoe&#8217;er I woo, myself would be his wife</verseline>
<scene>Scene V</scene>
<location>Olivia&#8217;s house</location>
<stage_directions>Enter Maria and Clown</stage_directions>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse; my lady will hang thee for thy absence</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Let her hang me. He that is well hang&#8217;d in this world needs to fear no colours</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Make that good</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>He shall see none to fear</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of &#8216;I fear no colours.&#8217;</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Where, good Mistress Mary?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Yet you will be hang&#8217;d for being so long absent; or to be turn&#8217;d away- is not that as good as a hanging to you?</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning away, let summer bear it out</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>You are resolute, then?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Not so, neither; but I am resolv&#8217;d on two points</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>That if one break, the other will hold; or if both break, your gaskins fall</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Apt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve&#8217;s flesh as any in Illyria</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Peace, you rogue, no more o&#8217; that. Here comes my lady. Make your excuse wisely, you were best</prose>
<stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Enter Olivia and Malvolio</stage_directions>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Wit, an&#8217;t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? &#8216;Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.&#8217; God bless thee, lady!</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Take the fool away</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>Go to, y&#8217;are a dry fool; I&#8217;ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest</prose>

<prose>Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend; for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that&#8217;s mended is but patch&#8217;d; virtue that transgresses is but patch&#8217;d with sin, and sin that amends is but patch&#8217;d with virtue.If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty&#8217;s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Sir, I bade them take away you</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, &#8216;Cucullus non facit monachum&#8217;; that&#8217;s as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Can you do it?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Dexteriously, good madonna</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Make your proof</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>I must catechize you for it, madonna</verseline>
<verseline>Good my mouse of virtue, answer me</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I&#8217;ll bide your proof</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Good madonna, why mourn&#8217;st thou?</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Good fool, for my brother&#8217;s death</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>I think his soul is in hell, madonna</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>I know his soul is in heaven, fool</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother&#8217;s soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>What think you of this fool, Malvolio? Doth he not mend?</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>Yes, and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him</prose>
<prose>Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>How say you to that, Malvolio?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he&#8217;s out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagg&#8217;d. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools&#8217; zanies</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distemper&#8217;d appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allow&#8217;d fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove</prose>
<character>Clown</character>

<prose>Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>From the Count Orsino, is it?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>I know not, madam; &#8216;tis a fair young man, and well attended</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Who of my people hold him in delay?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman</verseline>

<prose>Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman</prose>
<prose>Fie on him! </prose>
<stage_directions>[Exit Maria]</stage_directions>

<stage_directions>[Exit Malvolio] </stage_directions>
<prose>Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it</prose>
<character>Clown</character>

<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>By mine honour, half drunk! What is he at the gate, cousin?</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>A gentleman</verseline>

<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>&#8216;Tis a gentleman here. <stage_directions_inline>[Hiccups]</stage_directions_inline> A plague o&#8217; these pickle-herring! How now, sot!</prose>

<prose>Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Lechery! I defy lechery. There&#8217;s one at the gate</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Ay, marry; what is he?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Let him be the devil an he will, I care not; give me faith, say I. Well, it&#8217;s all one. </prose>
<stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>What&#8217;s a drunken man like, fool?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Like a drown&#8217;d man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads him; and a third drowns him</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o&#8217; my coz; for he&#8217;s in the third degree of drink, he&#8217;s drown&#8217;d; go look after him</prose>

<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? He&#8217;s fortified against any denial</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Tell him he shall not speak with me</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>Has been told so; and he says he&#8217;ll stand at your door like a sheriff&#8217;s post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he&#8217;ll speak with you</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>What kind o&#8217; man is he?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Why, of mankind</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>What manner of man?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Of very ill manner; he&#8217;ll speak with you, will you or no</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Of what personage and years is he?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before &#8216;tis a peascod, or a codling when &#8216;tis almost an apple; &#8216;tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favour&#8217;d, and he speaks very shrewishly; one would think his mother&#8217;s milk were scarce out of him</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman</verseline>

<verseline>Gentlewoman, my lady calls. </verseline>

<verseline>We&#8217;ll once more hear Orsino&#8217;s embassy</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Viola</stage_directions>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>The honourable lady of the house, which is she?</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty- I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is excellently well penn&#8217;d, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Whence came you, sir?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>I can say little more than I have studied, and that question&#8217;s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Are you a comedian?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>No, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>If I do not usurp myself, I am</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Come to what is important in&#8217;t. I forgive you the praise</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Alas, I took great pains to study it, and &#8216;tis poetical</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allow&#8217;d your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief; &#8216;tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping dialogue</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer</verseline>
<verseline>Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Tell me your mind</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I am a messenger</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as full of peace as matter</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>The rudeness that hath appear&#8217;d in me have I learn&#8217;d from my entertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead- to your cars, divinity; to any other&#8217;s, profanation</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Give us the place alone; we will hear this divinity</verseline>
<stage_directions>[Exeunt Maria and Attendants] </stage_directions>
<verseline>Now, sir, what is your text?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Most sweet lady-</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it</verseline>
<verseline>Where lies your text?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>In Orsino&#8217;s bosom</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>To answer by the method: in the first of his heart</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Good madam, let me see your face</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text; but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. </prose>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>[Unveiling]</stage_directions_inline> Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is&#8217;t not well done?</prose>

<verseline>Excellently done, if God did all</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis in grain, sir; &#8216;twill endure wind and weather</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white</verseline>
<verseline>Nature&#8217;s own sweet and cunning hand laid on</verseline>
<verseline>Lady, you are the cruell&#8217;st she alive,</verseline>
<verseline>If you will lead these graces to the grave,</verseline>
<verseline>And leave the world no copy</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labell&#8217;d to my will: as- item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I see you what you are: you are too proud;</verseline>
<verseline>But, if you were the devil, you are fair</verseline>
<verseline>My lord and master loves you- O, such love</verseline>
<verseline>Could be but recompens&#8217;d though you were crown&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>The nonpareil of beauty!</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>How does he love me?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>With adorations, fertile tears,</verseline>
<verseline>With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him</verseline>
<verseline>Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,</verseline>
<verseline>Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;</verseline>
<verseline>In voices well divulg&#8217;d, free, learn&#8217;d, and valiant,</verseline>
<verseline>And in dimension and the shape of nature</verseline>
<verseline>A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him</verseline>
<verseline>He might have took his answer long ago</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>If I did love you in my master&#8217;s flame,</verseline>
<verseline>With such a suff&#8217;ring, such a deadly life,</verseline>
<verseline>In your denial I would find no sense;</verseline>
<verseline>I would not understand it</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Why, what would you?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Make me a willow cabin at your gate,</verseline>
<verseline>And call upon my soul within the house;</verseline>
<verseline>Write loyal cantons of contemned love</verseline>
<verseline>And sing them loud even in the dead of night;</verseline>
<verseline>Halloo your name to the reverberate hals,</verseline>

<verseline>Cry out &#8216;Olivia!&#8217; O, you should not rest</verseline>

<character>Antonio</character>
<prose>Will you stay no longer; nor will you not that I go with you?</prose>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<prose>By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you</prose>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Let me know of you whither you are bound</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<prose>No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I call&#8217;d Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour; if the heavens had been pleas&#8217;d, would we had so ended! But you, sir, alter&#8217;d that; for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drown&#8217;d</prose>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Alas the day!</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<prose>A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful; but though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her: she bore mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drown&#8217;d already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more</prose>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment</verseline>

<verseline>O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble</verseline>

<prose>If you will not undo what you have done- that is, kill him whom you have recover&#8217;d-desire it not.

<prose>She returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one thing more: that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord&#8217;s taking of this. Receive it so</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>She took the ring of me; I&#8217;ll none of it</verseline>

<verseline>I left no ring with her; what means this lady?</verseline>
<verseline>Fortune forbid my outside have not charm&#8217;d her!</verseline>
<verseline>She made good view of me; indeed, so much</verseline>
<verseline>That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,</verseline>
<verseline>For she did speak in starts distractedly</verseline>
<verseline>She loves me, sure: the cunning of her passion</verseline>
<verseline>Invites me in this churlish messenger</verseline>
<verseline>None of my lord&#8217;s ring! Why, he sent her none</verseline>
<verseline>I am the man. If it be so- as &#8216;tis-</verseline>
<verseline>Poor lady, she were better love a dream</verseline>

<prose>A false conclusion! I hate it as an unfill&#8217;d can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then is early; so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four elements?</prose>

<prose>By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spok&#8217;st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus; &#8216;twas very good, i&#8217; faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman; hadst it?</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio&#8217;s nose is no whipstock. My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a song</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Come on, there is sixpence for you. Let&#8217;s have a song</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>There&#8217;s a testril of me too; if one knight give a-</verseline>

<verseline>Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>A love-song, a love-song</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Ay, ay; I care not for good life</verseline>
<stage_directions>Clown sings</stage_directions>
<verseline>O mistress mine, where are you roaming?</verseline>
<verseline>O, stay and hear; your true love&#8217;s coming,</verseline>
<verseline>That can sing both high and low</verseline>
<verseline>Trip no further, pretty sweeting;</verseline>
<verseline>Journeys end in lovers meeting,</verseline>

<verseline>What is love? &#8216;Tis not hereafter;</verseline>
<verseline>Present mirth hath present laughter;</verseline>
<verseline>What&#8217;s to come is still unsure</verseline>
<verseline>In delay there lies no plenty,</verseline>

<verseline>Very sweet and contagious, i&#8217; faith</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>An you love me, let&#8217;s do&#8217;t. I am dog at a catch</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>By&#8217;r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well</verseline>

<verseline>Most certain. Let our catch be &#8216;Thou knave.&#8217;</verseline>

<prose>My masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an ale-house of my lady&#8217;s house, that ye squeak out your coziers&#8217; catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time, in you?</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you that, though she harbours you as her kins-man, she&#8217;s nothing allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house; if not, and it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell</prose>

<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Do&#8217;t, knight. I&#8217;ll write thee a challenge; or I&#8217;ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night; since the youth of the Count&#8217;s was to-day with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him; if I do not gull him into a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>O, if I thought that, I&#8217;d beat him like a dog</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>What, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>I have no exquisite reason for&#8217;t, but I have reason good enough</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser; an affection&#8217;d ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so cramm&#8217;d, as he thinks, with excellencies that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>What wilt thou do?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady, your niece; on forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Excellent! I smell a device</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>I have&#8217;t in my nose too</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she&#8217;s in love with him</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>And your horse now would make him an ass</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Ass, I doubt not</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>O, &#8216;twill be admirable!</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter; observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell</prose>

<verseline>Good night, Penthesilea</verseline>

<verseline>Before me, she&#8217;s a good wench</verseline>

<prose>She&#8217;s a beagle true-bred, and one that adores me. What o&#8217; that?</prose>

<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Let&#8217;s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money</prose>

<stage_directions>Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and Others</stage_directions>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends</verseline>
<verseline>Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,</verseline>
<verseline>That old and antique song we heard last night;</verseline>
<verseline>Methought it did relieve my passion much,</verseline>
<verseline>More than light airs and recollected terms</verseline>
<verseline>Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times</verseline>
<verseline>Come, but one verse</verseline>
<character>Curio</character>
<prose>He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Who was it?</verseline>
<character>Curio</character>
<prose>Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the Lady Olivia&#8217;s father took much delight in. He is about the house</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Seek him out, and play the tune the while</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Curio. [Music plays]</stage_directions>
<verseline>Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,</verseline>
<verseline>In the sweet pangs of it remember me;</verseline>
<verseline>For such as I am all true lovers are,</verseline>
<verseline>Unstaid and skittish in all motions else</verseline>
<verseline>Save in the constant image of the creature</verseline>
<verseline>That is belov&#8217;d. How dost thou like this tune?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>It gives a very echo to the seat</verseline>
<verseline>Where Love is thron&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Thou dost speak masterly</verseline>
<verseline>My life upon&#8217;t, young though thou art, thine eye</verseline>
<verseline>Hath stay&#8217;d upon some favour that it loves;</verseline>
<verseline>Hath it not, boy?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>A little, by your favour</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>What kind of woman is&#8217;t?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Of your complexion</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>She is not worth thee, then. What years, i&#8217; faith?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>About your years, my lord</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Too old, by heaven! Let still the woman take</verseline>
<verseline>An elder than herself; so wears she to him,</verseline>
<verseline>So sways she level in her husband&#8217;s heart</verseline>
<verseline>For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,</verseline>
<verseline>Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,</verseline>
<verseline>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won,</verseline>
<verseline>Than women&#8217;s are</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I think it well, my lord</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Then let thy love be younger than thyself,</verseline>
<verseline>Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;</verseline>
<verseline>For women are as roses, whose fair flow&#8217;r</verseline>
<verseline>Being once display&#8217;d doth fall that very hour</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>And so they are; alas, that they are so!</verseline>
<verseline>To die, even when they to perfection grow!</verseline>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Curio and Clown</stage_directions>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>O, fellow, come, the song we had last night</verseline>
<verseline>Mark it, Cesario; it is old and plain;</verseline>
<verseline>The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,</verseline>
<verseline>And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,</verseline>
<verseline>Do use to chant it; it is silly sooth,</verseline>
<verseline>And dallies with the innocence of love,</verseline>
<verseline>Like the old age</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Are you ready, sir?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Ay; prithee, sing. <stage_directions_inline>[Music]</stage_directions_inline>

<verseline>Fly away, fly away, breath,</verseline>
<verseline>I am slain by a fair cruel maid</verseline>
<verseline>My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,</verseline>
<verseline>O, prepare it!</verseline>
<verseline>My part of death no one so true</verseline>
<verseline>Did share it</verseline>
<verseline>Not a flower, not a flower sweet,</verseline>
<verseline>On my black coffin let there be strown;</verseline>
<verseline>Not a friend, not a friend greet</verseline>
<verseline>My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown;</verseline>
<verseline>A thousand thousand to save,</verseline>
<verseline>Lay me, O, where</verseline>
<verseline>Sad true lover never find my grave,</verseline>
<verseline>To weep there!</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>There&#8217;s for thy pains</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll pay thy pleasure, then</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Give me now leave to leave thee</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Now the melancholy god protect thee; and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything, and their intent everywhere: for that&#8217;s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell</prose>

<stage_directions>Exeunt Curio and Attendants</stage_directions>
<verseline>Once more, Cesario,</verseline>
<verseline>Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty</verseline>
<verseline>Tell her my love, more noble than the world,</verseline>
<verseline>Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;</verseline>
<verseline>The parts that fortune hath bestow&#8217;d upon her,</verseline>
<verseline>Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune;</verseline>
<verseline>But &#8216;tis that miracle and queen of gems</verseline>
<verseline>That Nature pranks her in attracts my soul</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>But if she cannot love you, sir?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>I cannot be so answer&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Sooth, but you must</verseline>
<verseline>Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,</verseline>
<verseline>Hath for your love as great a pang of heart</verseline>
<verseline>As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;</verseline>
<verseline>You tell her so. Must she not then be answer&#8217;d?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>There is no woman&#8217;s sides</verseline>
<verseline>Can bide the beating of so strong a passion</verseline>
<verseline>As love doth give my heart; no woman&#8217;s heart</verseline>
<verseline>So big to hold so much; they lack retention</verseline>
<verseline>Alas, their love may be call&#8217;d appetite-</verseline>
<verseline>No motion of the liver, but the palate-</verseline>
<verseline>That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;</verseline>
<verseline>But mine is all as hungry as the sea,</verseline>
<verseline>And can digest as much. Make no compare</verseline>
<verseline>Between that love a woman can bear me</verseline>
<verseline>And that I owe Olivia</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Ay, but I know-</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>What dost thou know?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Too well what love women to men may owe</verseline>
<verseline>In faith, they are as true of heart as we</verseline>
<verseline>My father had a daughter lov&#8217;d a man,</verseline>
<verseline>As it might be perhaps, were I a woman,</verseline>
<verseline>I should your lordship</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>And what&#8217;s her history?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>A blank, my lord. She never told her love,</verseline>
<verseline>But let concealment, like a worm i&#8217; th&#8217; bud,</verseline>
<verseline>Feed on her damask cheek. She pin&#8217;d in thought;</verseline>
<verseline>And with a green and yellow melancholy</verseline>
<verseline>She sat like Patience on a monument,</verseline>
<verseline>Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?</verseline>
<verseline>We men may say more, swear more, but indeed</verseline>
<verseline>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove</verseline>
<verseline>Much in our vows, but little in our love</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>But died thy sister of her love, my boy?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I am all the daughters of my father&#8217;s house,</verseline>
<verseline>And all the brothers too- and yet I know not</verseline>
<verseline>Sir, shall I to this lady?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Ay, that&#8217;s the theme</verseline>
<verseline>To her in haste. Give her this jewel; say</verseline>
<verseline>My love can give no place, bide no denay. </verseline>

<verseline>O, peace, peace!</verseline>

<prose>Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance wind up my watch, or play with my- some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me-</prose>

<verseline>&#8216;You must amend your drunkenness&#8217;-</verseline>

<verseline>Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot</verseline>

<prose>By my life, this is my lady&#8217;s hand: these be her very C&#8217;s, her U&#8217;s, and her T&#8217;s; and thus makes she her great P&#8217;s. It is, in contempt of question, her hand</prose>

<verseline>Her C&#8217;s, her U&#8217;s, and her T&#8217;s. Why that?</verseline>

<prose>&#8216;I may command where I adore.&#8217; Why, she may command me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity; there is no obstruction in this.

<prose>&#8216;If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon &#8216;em. Thy Fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them; and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wish&#8217;d to see thee ever cross-garter&#8217;d. I say, remember, Go to, thou art made, if thou desir&#8217;st to be so; if not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune&#8217;s fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee,</prose>

<prose>Daylight and champain discovers not more. This is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man. I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-garter&#8217;d; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-garter&#8217;d, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript</prose>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>[Reads]</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;Thou canst not choose but know who I am.

<verseline>Here comes my noble gull-catcher</verseline>

<verseline>Wilt thou set thy foot o&#8217; my neck?</verseline>

<verseline>Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?</verseline>

<prose>If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady.

<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Save thee, friend, and thy music!</verseline>
<verseline>Dost thou live by thy tabor?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>No, sir, I live by the church</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Art thou a churchman?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev&#8217;ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turn&#8217;d outward!</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>Nay, that&#8217;s certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>I would, therefore, my sister had had name, sir</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Why, man?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Why, sir, her name&#8217;s a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgrac&#8217;d them</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Thy reason, man?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car&#8217;st for nothing</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Not so, sir; I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Art not thou the Lady Olivia&#8217;s fool?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly; she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings- the husband&#8217;s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I saw thee late at the Count Orsino&#8217;s</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun- it shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress: think I saw your wisdom there</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Nay, an thou pass upon me, I&#8217;ll no more with thee</verseline>
<verseline>Hold, there&#8217;s expenses for thee. <stage_directions_inline>[Giving a coin]</stage_directions_inline>

<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send the a beard!</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>By my troth, I&#8217;ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one; <stage_directions_inline>[Aside]</stage_directions_inline> though I would not have it grow on my chin.- Is thy lady within?</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Yes, being kept together and put to use</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a</verseline>
<verseline>Cressida to this Troilus</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I understand you, sir; &#8216;tis well begg&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[Giving another coin]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will construe to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin- I might say &#8216;element&#8217; but the word is overworn</prose>
<stage_directions>Exit Clown</stage_directions>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;</verseline>
<verseline>And to do that well craves a kind of wit</verseline>
<verseline>He must observe their mood on whom he jests,</verseline>
<verseline>The quality of persons, and the time;</verseline>
<verseline>And, like the haggard, check at every feather</verseline>
<verseline>That comes before his eye. This is a practice</verseline>
<verseline>As full of labour as a wise man&#8217;s art;</verseline>
<verseline>For folly that he wisely shows is fit;</verseline>
<verseline>But wise men, folly-fall&#8217;n, quite taint their wit</verseline>

<verseline>What is your name?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Cesario is your servant&#8217;s name, fair Princess</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>My servant, sir! &#8216;Twas never merry world</verseline>
<verseline>Since lowly feigning was call&#8217;d compliment</verseline>
<verseline>Y&#8217;are servant to the Count Orsino, youth</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:</verseline>
<verseline>Your servant&#8217;s servant is your servant, madam</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>For him, I think not on him; for his thoughts,</verseline>
<verseline>Would they were blanks rather than fill&#8217;d with me!</verseline>

<verseline>Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts</verseline>
<verseline>On his behalf</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>O, by your leave, I pray you:</verseline>
<verseline>I bade you never speak again of him;</verseline>
<verseline>But, would you undertake another suit,</verseline>
<verseline>I had rather hear you to solicit that</verseline>
<verseline>Than music from the spheres</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Dear lady-</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,</verseline>
<verseline>After the last enchantment you did here,</verseline>
<verseline>A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse</verseline>
<verseline>Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you</verseline>
<verseline>Under your hard construction must I sit,</verseline>
<verseline>To force that on you in a shameful cunning</verseline>
<verseline>Which you knew none of yours. What might you think?</verseline>
<verseline>Have you not set mine honour at the stake,</verseline>
<verseline>And baited it with all th&#8217; unmuzzled thoughts</verseline>
<verseline>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving</verseline>
<verseline>Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,</verseline>
<verseline>Hides my heart. So, let me hear you speak</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I pity you</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>That&#8217;s a degree to love</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>No, not a grize; for &#8216;tis a vulgar proof</verseline>
<verseline>That very oft we pity enemies</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Why, then, methinks &#8216;tis time to smile again</verseline>
<verseline>O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!</verseline>
<verseline>If one should be a prey, how much the better</verseline>
<verseline>To fall before the lion than the wolf! <stage_directions_inline>[Clock strikes]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>The clock upbraids me with the waste of time</verseline>
<verseline>Be not afraid, good youth; I will not have you;</verseline>
<verseline>And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,</verseline>
<verseline>Your wife is like to reap a proper man</verseline>
<verseline>There lies your way, due west</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Then westward-ho!</verseline>
<verseline>Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!</verseline>
<verseline>You&#8217;ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?</verseline>

<verseline>Stay</verseline>
<verseline>I prithee tell me what thou think&#8217;st of me</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>That you do think you are not what you are</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>If I think so, I think the same of you</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Then think you right: I am not what I am</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>I would you were as I would have you be!</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Would it be better, madam, than I am?</verseline>
<verseline>I wish it might, for now I am your fool</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful</verseline>
<verseline>In the contempt and anger of his lip!</verseline>
<verseline>A murd&#8217;rous guilt shows not itself more soon</verseline>
<verseline>Than love that would seem hid: love&#8217;s night is noon</verseline>
<verseline>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</verseline>
<verseline>By maidhood, honour, truth, and every thing,</verseline>
<verseline>I love thee so that, maugre all thy pride,</verseline>
<verseline>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide</verseline>
<verseline>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</verseline>
<verseline>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;</verseline>
<verseline>But rather reason thus with reason fetter:</verseline>
<verseline>Love sought is good, but given unsought is better</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>By innocence I swear, and by my youth,</verseline>
<verseline>I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,</verseline>
<verseline>And that no woman has; nor never none</verseline>
<verseline>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone</verseline>
<verseline>And so adieu, good madam; never more</verseline>
<verseline>Will I my master&#8217;s tears to you deplore</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move</verseline>

<stage_directions>Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian</stage_directions>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>No, faith, I&#8217;ll not stay a jot longer</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count&#8217;s servingman than ever she bestow&#8217;d upon me; I saw&#8217;t i&#8217; th&#8217; orchard</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>As plain as I see you now</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>This was a great argument of love in her toward you</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Slight! will you make an ass o&#8217; me?</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her; and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have bang&#8217;d the youth into dumbness. This was look&#8217;d for at your hand, and this was baulk&#8217;d. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sail&#8217;d into the north of my lady&#8217;s opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchman&#8217;s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>An&#8217;t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me the Count&#8217;s youth to fight with him; hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall take note of it; and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man&#8217;s commendation with woman than report of valour</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>There is no way but this, Sir Andrew</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention</prose>
<prose>Taunt him with the license of ink; if thou thou&#8217;st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set &#8216;em down; go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Where shall I find you?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>We&#8217;ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Sir Andrew</stage_directions>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>This is a dear manakin to you, Sir Toby</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>I have been dear to him, lad- some two thousand strong, or so</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>We shall have a rare letter from him; but you&#8217;ll not deliver&#8217;t?</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open&#8217;d and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I&#8217;ll eat the rest of th&#8217; anatomy</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty</prose>
<stage_directions>Enter Maria</stage_directions>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Look where the youngest wren of nine comes</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He&#8217;s in yellow stockings</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>And cross-garter&#8217;d?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Most villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i&#8217; th&#8217; church. I have dogg&#8217;d him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropp&#8217;d to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as &#8216;tis; Ican hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him; if she do, he&#8217;ll smile and take&#8217;t for a great favour</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Come, bring us, bring us where he is. </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt</stage_directions>

<location>A street</location>
<stage_directions>Enter Sebastian and Antonio</stage_directions>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>I would not by my will have troubled you;</verseline>
<verseline>But since you make your pleasure of your pains,</verseline>
<verseline>I will no further chide you</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>I could not stay behind you: my desire,</verseline>
<verseline>More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;</verseline>
<verseline>And not all love to see you- though so much</verseline>
<verseline>As might have drawn one to a longer voyage-</verseline>
<verseline>But jealousy what might befall your travel,</verseline>
<verseline>Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,</verseline>
<verseline>Unguided and unfriended, often prove</verseline>
<verseline>Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,</verseline>
<verseline>The rather by these arguments of fear,</verseline>
<verseline>Set forth in your pursuit</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>My kind Antonio,</verseline>
<verseline>I can no other answer make but thanks,</verseline>
<verseline>And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns</verseline>
<verseline>Are shuffl&#8217;d off with such uncurrent pay;</verseline>
<verseline>But were my worth as is my conscience firm,</verseline>
<verseline>You should find better dealing. What&#8217;s to do?</verseline>
<verseline>Shall we go see the reliques of this town?</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>To-morrow, sir; best first go see your lodging</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>I am not weary, and &#8216;tis long to night;</verseline>
<verseline>I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes</verseline>
<verseline>With the memorials and the things of fame</verseline>
<verseline>That do renown this city</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Would you&#8217;d pardon me</verseline>
<verseline>I do not without danger walk these streets:</verseline>
<verseline>Once in a sea-fight &#8216;gainst the Count his galleys</verseline>
<verseline>I did some service; of such note, indeed,</verseline>
<verseline>That, were I ta&#8217;en here, it would scarce be answer&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>Belike you slew great number of his people</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Th&#8217; offence is not of such a bloody nature;</verseline>
<verseline>Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel</verseline>
<verseline>Might well have given us bloody argument</verseline>
<verseline>It might have since been answer&#8217;d in repaying</verseline>
<verseline>What we took from them; which, for traffic&#8217;s sake,</verseline>
<verseline>Most of our city did. Only myself stood out;</verseline>
<verseline>For which, if I be lapsed in this place,</verseline>
<verseline>I shall pay dear</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>Do not then walk too open</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here&#8217;s my purse;</verseline>
<verseline>In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,</verseline>
<verseline>Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet,</verseline>
<verseline>Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge</verseline>
<verseline>With viewing of the town; there shall you have me</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>Why I your purse?</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Haply your eye shall light upon some toy</verseline>
<verseline>You have desire to purchase; and your store,</verseline>
<verseline>I think, is not for idle markets, sir</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for</verseline>
<verseline>An hour</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>To th&#8217; Elephant</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>I do remember. </verseline>

<location>Olivia&#8217;s garden</location>
<stage_directions>Enter Olivia and Maria</stage_directions>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>I have sent after him; he says he&#8217;ll come</verseline>
<verseline>How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?</verseline>
<verseline>For youth is bought more oft than begg&#8217;d or borrow&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>I speak too loud</verseline>
<verseline>Where&#8217;s Malvolio? He is sad and civil,</verseline>
<verseline>And suits well for a servant with my fortunes</verseline>
<verseline>Where is Malvolio?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>He&#8217;s coming, madam; but in very strange manner</verseline>
<verseline>He is sure possess&#8217;d, madam</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Why, what&#8217;s the matter? Does he rave?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>No, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come; for sure the man is tainted in&#8217;s wits</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Go call him hither. </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Maria</stage_directions>
<verseline>I am as mad as he,</verseline>
<verseline>If sad and merry madness equal be</verseline>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Maria with Malvolio</stage_directions>
<verseline>How now, Malvolio!</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Sweet lady, ho, ho</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Smil&#8217;st thou?</verseline>
<verseline>I sent for thee upon a sad occasion</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>Sad, lady? I could be sad. This does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: &#8216;Please one and please all.&#8217;</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs</prose>
<prose>It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>To bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I&#8217;ll come to thee</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft?</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>How do you, Malvolio?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>At your request? Yes, nightingales answer daws!</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Be not afraid of greatness.&#8217; &#8216;Twas well writ</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>What mean&#8217;st thou by that, Malvolio?</verseline>
<character>Aialvolio</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Some are born great,&#8217;-</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Ha?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Some achieve greatness,&#8217;-</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>What say&#8217;st thou?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>&#8216;And some have greatness thrust upon them.&#8217;</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Heaven restore thee!</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,&#8217;-</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Thy yellow stockings?&#8217;</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>&#8216;And wish&#8217;d to see thee cross-garterd.&#8217;</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Cross-garter&#8217;d?&#8217;</verseline>

<verseline>&#8216;Go to, thou an made, if thou desir&#8217;st to be so&#8217;;-</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Am I made?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>&#8216;If not, let me see thee a servant still.&#8217;</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Why, this is very midsummer madness</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Servant</stage_directions>
<character>Servant</character>
<prose>Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino&#8217;s is return&#8217;d; I could hardly entreat him back; he attends your ladyship&#8217;s pleasure</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<prose>I&#8217;ll come to him. </prose>
<stage_directions>[Exit Servant] </stage_directions>
<prose>Good Maria, let this fellow be look&#8217;d to. Where&#8217;s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry</prose>
<stage_directions>Exeunt Olivia and Maria</stage_directions>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>O, ho! do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. &#8216;Cast thy humble slough,&#8217; says she. &#8216;Be opposite with kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity&#8217; and consequently sets down the manner how, as: a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have lim&#8217;d her; but it is Jove&#8217;s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now- &#8216;Let this fellow be look&#8217;d to.&#8217; &#8216;Fellow,&#8217; not &#8216;Malvolio&#8217; nor after my degree, but &#8216;fellow.&#8217; Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance- What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked</prose>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Maria, with Sir Toby and Fabian</stage_directions>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possess&#8217;d him, yet I&#8217;ll speak to him</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Here he is, here he is. How is&#8217;t with you, sir?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>How is&#8217;t with you, man?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Go off; I discard you. Let me enjoy my private; go off</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Ah, ha! does she so?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently with him. Let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? How is&#8217;t with you? What, man, defy the devil; consider, he&#8217;s an enemy to mankind</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Do you know what you say?</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not bewitched</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Carry his water to th&#8217; wise woman</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than I&#8217;ll say</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>How now, mistress!</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>O Lord!</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Prithee hold thy peace; this is not the way. Do you not see you move him? Let me alone with him</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>No way but gentleness- gently, gently. The fiend is rough, and will not be roughly us&#8217;d</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Why, how now, my bawcock!</verseline>
<verseline>How dost thou, chuck?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Sir!</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man, &#8216;tis not for gravity to play at cherrypit with Satan. Hang him, foul collier!</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>My prayers, minx!</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>Go, hang yourselves all! You are idle shallow things; I am not of your element; you shall know more hereafter</prose>
<stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Is&#8217;t possible?</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>If this were play&#8217;d upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man</prose>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Why, we shall make him mad indeed</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<verseline>The house will be the quieter</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Come, we&#8217;ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he&#8217;s mad. We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him; at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see</prose>
<stage_directions>Enter Sir Andrew</stage_directions>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>More matter for a May morning</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Here&#8217;s the challenge; read it. I warrant there&#8217;s vinegar and pepper in&#8217;t</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Is&#8217;t so saucy?</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Ay, is&#8217;t, I warrant him; do but read</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Give me. <stage_directions_inline>[Reads]</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.&#8217;</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Good and valiant</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>[Reads]</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for&#8217;t.&#8217;</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>[Reads]</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;Thou com&#8217;st to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly; but thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.&#8217;</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Very brief, and to exceeding good sense- less</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>[Reads]</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;I will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance to kill me&#8217;-</prose>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Good</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>&#8216;Thou kill&#8217;st me like a rogue and a villain.&#8217;</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Still you keep o&#8217; th&#8217; windy side of the law. Good!</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>[Reads]</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,</prose>
<character>Andrew Aguecheek.&#8217;</character>
<verseline>If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I&#8217;ll give&#8217;t him</verseline>
<character>Maria</character>
<prose>You may have very fit occasion for&#8217;t; he is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Go, Sir Andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the orchard, like a bum-baily; so soon as ever thou seest him, draw; and as thou draw&#8217;st, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twang&#8217;d off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earn&#8217;d him. Away</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Nay, let me alone for swearing</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Now will not I deliver his letter; for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the gentleman- as know his youth will aptly receive it- into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices</prose>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Olivia. With Viola</stage_directions>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>Here he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave, and presently after him</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge</prose>
<stage_directions>Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian, and Maria</stage_directions>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>I have said too much unto a heart of stone,</verseline>
<verseline>And laid mine honour too unchary out;</verseline>
<verseline>There&#8217;s something in me that reproves my fault;</verseline>
<verseline>But such a headstrong potent fault it is</verseline>
<verseline>That it but mocks reproof</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>With the same haviour that your passion bears</verseline>
<verseline>Goes on my master&#8217;s griefs</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Here, wear this jewel for me; &#8216;tis my picture</verseline>
<verseline>Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you</verseline>
<verseline>And I beseech you come again to-morrow</verseline>
<verseline>What shall you ask of me that I&#8217;ll deny,</verseline>
<verseline>That honour sav&#8217;d may upon asking give?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Nothing but this- your true love for my master</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>How with mine honour may I give him that</verseline>
<verseline>Which I have given to you?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I will acquit you</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Well, come again to-morrow. Fare thee well;</verseline>
<verseline>A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell. </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Sir Toby and Sir Fabian</stage_directions>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>Gentleman, God save thee</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>And you, sir</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>That defence thou hast, betake thee tot. Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me; my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>You&#8217;ll find it otherwise, I assure you; therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I pray you, sir, what is he?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>He is knight, dubb&#8217;d with unhatch&#8217;d rapier and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorc&#8217;d three; and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob-nob is his word- give&#8217;t or take&#8217;t</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour; belike this is a man of that quirk</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury; therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him; therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that&#8217;s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>I Will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return</prose>
<stage_directions>Exit Sir Toby</stage_directions>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>I know the knight is incens&#8217;d against you, even to a mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I beseech you, what manner of man is he?</verseline>

<prose>Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<prose>I shall be much bound to you for&#8217;t. I am one that would rather go with sir priest than sir knight. I care not who knows so much of my mettle. </prose>

<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Why, man, he&#8217;s a very devil; I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>Pox on&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll not meddle with him</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Ay, but he will not now be pacified; Fabian can scarce hold him yonder</prose>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Plague on&#8217;t; an I thought he had been valiant, and so cunning in fence, I&#8217;d have seen him damn&#8217;d ere I&#8217;d have challeng&#8217;d him. Let him let the matter slip, and I&#8217;ll give him my horse, grey Capilet</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>I&#8217;ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on&#8217;t; this shall end without the perdition of souls. <stage_directions_inline>[Aside]</stage_directions_inline> Marry, I&#8217;ll ride your horse as well as I ride you</prose>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Fabian and Viola</stage_directions>

<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>[To Viola]</stage_directions_inline> There&#8217;s no remedy, sir: he will fight with you for&#8217;s oath sake.

<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Come, Sir Andrew, there&#8217;s no remedy; the gentleman will, for his honour&#8217;s sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the duello avoid it; but he has promis&#8217;d me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on; to&#8217;t</prose>

<verseline>You, sir! Why, what are you?</verseline>

<verseline>No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,</verseline>

<verseline>What will you do, now my necessity</verseline>
<verseline>Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me</verseline>
<verseline>Much more for what I cannot do for you</verseline>

<verseline>What money, sir?</verseline>
<verseline>For the fair kindness you have show&#8217;d me here,</verseline>
<verseline>And part being prompted by your present trouble,</verseline>
<verseline>Out of my lean and low ability</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll lend you something. My having is not much;</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll make division of my present with you;</verseline>
<verseline>Hold, there&#8217;s half my coffer</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Will you deny me now?</verseline>
<verseline>Is&#8217;t possible that my deserts to you</verseline>
<verseline>Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,</verseline>
<verseline>Lest that it make me so unsound a man</verseline>
<verseline>As to upbraid you with those kindnesses</verseline>
<verseline>That I have done for you</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>I know of none,</verseline>
<verseline>Nor know I you by voice or any feature</verseline>
<verseline>I hate ingratitude more in a man</verseline>

<verseline>O heavens themselves!</verseline>

<verseline>Come, sir, I pray you go</verseline>

<verseline>What&#8217;s that to us? The time goes by; away</verseline>

<verseline>But, O, how vile an idol proves this god!</verseline>
<verseline>Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame</verseline>
<verseline>In nature there&#8217;s no blemish but the mind:</verseline>
<verseline>None can be call&#8217;d deform&#8217;d but the unkind</verseline>

<prose>Well held out, i&#8217; faith! No, I do not know you; nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so</prose>

<prose>Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness, and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?</prose>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me;</verseline>
<verseline>There&#8217;s money for thee; if you tarry longer</verseline>

<prose>Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Say&#8217;st thou that house is dark?</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>As hell, Sir Topas</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of obstruction?</prose>

<verseline>I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark</verseline>

<prose>Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>I say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say there was never man thus abus&#8217;d. I am no more mad than you are; make the trial of it in any constant question</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?</verseline>

<verseline>What think&#8217;st thou of his opinion?</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<prose>I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness: thou shalt</prose>

<prose>Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown: he sees thee not</prose>

<prose>To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find&#8217;st him. I would we were well rid of this knavery.

<verseline>And wrangle with my reason, that persuades me</verseline>
<verseline>To any other trust but that I am mad,</verseline>
<verseline>Or else the lady&#8217;s mad; yet if &#8216;twere so,</verseline>
<verseline>She could not sway her house, command her followers,</verseline>
<verseline>Take and give back affairs and their dispatch</verseline>
<verseline>With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing,</verseline>
<verseline>As I perceive she does. There&#8217;s something in&#8217;t</verseline>
<verseline>That is deceivable. But here the lady comes</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Olivia and Priest</stage_directions>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,</verseline>
<verseline>Now go with me and with this holy man</verseline>
<verseline>Into the chantry by; there, before him</verseline>
<verseline>And underneath that consecrated roof,</verseline>
<verseline>Plight me the fun assurance of your faith,</verseline>
<verseline>That my most jealous and too doubtful soul</verseline>
<verseline>May live at peace. He shall conceal it</verseline>
<verseline>Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,</verseline>
<verseline>What time we will our celebration keep</verseline>
<verseline>According to my birth. What do you say?</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll follow this good man, and go with you;</verseline>
<verseline>And, having sworn truth, ever will be true</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine</verseline>
<verseline>That they may fairly note this act of mine! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt</stage_directions>
<act>Act V</act>
<firstscene>Scene I</firstscene>
<location>Before Olivia&#8217;s house</location>
<stage_directions>Enter Clown and Fabian</stage_directions>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Now, as thou lov&#8217;st me, let me see his letter</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Good Master Fabian, grant me another request</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Anything</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Do not desire to see this letter</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>This is to give a dog, and in recompense desire my dog again</prose>
<stage_directions>Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and Lords</stage_directions>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Just the contrary: the better for thy friends</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>No, sir, the worse</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>How can that be?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused; so that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then, the worse for my friends, and the better for my foes</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Why, this is excellent</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Thou shalt not be the worse for me. There&#8217;s gold</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>O, you give me ill counsel</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer</verseline>
<verseline>There&#8217;s another</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old saying is &#8216;The third pays for all.&#8217; The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind- one, two, three</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<prose>You can fool no more money out of me at this throw; if you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further</prose>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness. But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap; I will awake it anon. </prose>
<stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Enter Antonio and Officers</stage_directions>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>That face of his I do remember well;</verseline>
<verseline>Yet when I saw it last it was besmear&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war</verseline>
<verseline>A baubling vessel was he captain of,</verseline>
<verseline>For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,</verseline>
<verseline>With which such scathful grapple did he make</verseline>
<verseline>With the most noble bottom of our fleet</verseline>
<verseline>That very envy and the tongue of los</verseline>
<verseline>Cried fame and honour on him. What&#8217;s the matter?</verseline>
<character>First Officer</character>
<verseline>Orsino, this is that Antonio</verseline>
<verseline>That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;</verseline>
<verseline>And this is he that did the Tiger board</verseline>
<verseline>When your young nephew Titus lost his leg</verseline>
<verseline>Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,</verseline>
<verseline>In private brabble did we apprehend him</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>He did me kindness, sir; drew on my side;</verseline>
<verseline>But in conclusion put strange speech upon me</verseline>
<verseline>I know not what &#8216;twas but distraction</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Notable pirate, thou salt-water thief!</verseline>
<verseline>What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies</verseline>
<verseline>Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,</verseline>
<verseline>Hast made thine enemies?</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Orsino, noble sir,</verseline>
<verseline>Be pleas&#8217;d that I shake off these names you give me:</verseline>
<verseline>Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,</verseline>
<verseline>Though I confess, on base and ground enough,</verseline>
<verseline>Orsino&#8217;s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:</verseline>
<verseline>That most ingrateful boy there by your side</verseline>
<verseline>From the rude sea&#8217;s enrag&#8217;d and foamy mouth</verseline>
<verseline>Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was</verseline>
<verseline>His life I gave him, and did thereto ad</verseline>
<verseline>My love without retention or restraint,</verseline>
<verseline>All his in dedication; for his sake,</verseline>
<verseline>Did I expose myself, pure for his love,</verseline>
<verseline>Into the danger of this adverse town;</verseline>
<verseline>Drew to defend him when he was beset;</verseline>
<verseline>Where being apprehended, his false cunning,</verseline>
<verseline>Not meaning to partake with me in danger,</verseline>
<verseline>Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,</verseline>
<verseline>And grew a twenty years removed thing</verseline>
<verseline>While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,</verseline>
<verseline>Which I had recommended to his use</verseline>
<verseline>Not half an hour before</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>How can this be?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>When came he to this town?</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>To-day, my lord; and for three months before,</verseline>
<verseline>No int&#8217;rim, not a minute&#8217;s vacancy,</verseline>
<verseline>Both day and night did we keep company</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Olivia and Attendants</stage_directions>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Here comes the Countess; now heaven walks on earth</verseline>
<verseline>But for thee, fellow- fellow, thy words are madness</verseline>
<verseline>Three months this youth hath tended upon me-</verseline>
<verseline>But more of that anon. Take him aside</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>What would my lord, but that he may not have,</verseline>
<verseline>Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?</verseline>
<verseline>Cesario, you do not keep promise with me</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Madam?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Gracious Olivia-</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord-</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>My lord would speak; my duty hushes me</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,</verseline>
<verseline>It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear</verseline>
<verseline>As howling after music</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Still so cruel?</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Still so constant, lord</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>What, to perverseness? You uncivil lady,</verseline>
<verseline>To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars</verseline>
<verseline>My soul the faithfull&#8217;st off&#8217;rings hath breath&#8217;d out</verseline>
<verseline>That e&#8217;er devotion tender&#8217;d! What shall I do?</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Even what it please my lord, that shall become him</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,</verseline>
<verseline>Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,</verseline>
<verseline>Kill what I love?- a savage jealousy</verseline>
<verseline>That sometime savours nobly. But hear me this:</verseline>
<verseline>Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,</verseline>
<verseline>And that I partly know the instrument</verseline>
<verseline>That screws me from my true place in your favour,</verseline>
<verseline>Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;</verseline>
<verseline>But this your minion, whom I know you love,</verseline>
<verseline>And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,</verseline>
<verseline>Him will I tear out of that cruel eye</verseline>
<verseline>Where he sits crowned in his master&#8217;s spite</verseline>
<verseline>Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love</verseline>
<verseline>To spite a raven&#8217;s heart within a dove</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,</verseline>
<verseline>To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Where goes Cesario?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>After him I love</verseline>
<verseline>More than I love these eyes, more than my life,</verseline>
<verseline>More, by all mores, than e&#8217;er I shall love wife</verseline>
<verseline>If I do feign, you witnesses above</verseline>
<verseline>Punish my life for tainting of my love!</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Ay me, detested! How am I beguil&#8217;d!</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?</verseline>
<verseline>Call forth the holy father</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit an Attendant</stage_directions>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Come, away!</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Husband?</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Ay, husband; can he that deny?</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Her husband, sirrah?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>No, my lord, not I</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear</verseline>
<verseline>That makes thee strangle thy propriety</verseline>
<verseline>Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up;</verseline>
<verseline>Be that thou know&#8217;st thou art, and then thou art</verseline>
<verseline>As great as that thou fear&#8217;st</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Priest</stage_directions>
<verseline>O, welcome, father!</verseline>
<verseline>Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,</verseline>
<verseline>Here to unfold- though lately we intended</verseline>
<verseline>To keep in darkness what occasion now</verseline>
<verseline>Reveals before &#8216;tis ripe- what thou dost know</verseline>
<verseline>Hath newly pass&#8217;d between this youth and me</verseline>
<character>Priest</character>
<verseline>A contract of eternal bond of love,</verseline>
<verseline>Confirm&#8217;d by mutual joinder of your hands,</verseline>
<verseline>Attested by the holy close of lips,</verseline>
<verseline>Strength&#8217;ned by interchangement of your rings;</verseline>
<verseline>And all the ceremony of this compact</verseline>
<verseline>Seal&#8217;d in my function, by my testimony;</verseline>
<verseline>Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave,</verseline>
<verseline>I have travell&#8217;d but two hours</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be,</verseline>
<verseline>When time hath sow&#8217;d a grizzle on thy case?</verseline>
<verseline>Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow</verseline>
<verseline>That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?</verseline>
<verseline>Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet</verseline>
<verseline>Where thou and I henceforth may never meet</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>My lord, I do protest-</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>O, do not swear!</verseline>
<verseline>Hold little faith, though thou has too much fear</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Sir Andrew</stage_directions>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<verseline>For the love of God, a surgeon!</verseline>
<verseline>Send one presently to Sir Toby</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>What&#8217;s the matter?</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Who has done this, Sir Andrew?</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>The Count&#8217;s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he&#8217;s the very devil incardinate</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>My gentleman, Cesario?</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>Od&#8217;s lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for nothing; and that that did, I was set on to do&#8217;t by Sir Toby</prose>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you</verseline>
<verseline>You drew your sword upon me without cause;</verseline>
<verseline>But I bespake you fair and hurt you not</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Sir Toby and Clown</stage_directions>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me; I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more; but if he had not been in drink, he would have tickl&#8217;d you othergates than he did</prose>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>How now, gentleman? How is&#8217;t with you?</verseline>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<verseline>That&#8217;s all one; has hurt me, and there&#8217;s th&#8217; end on&#8217;t</verseline>
<verseline>Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>O, he&#8217;s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at eight i&#8217; th&#8217; morning</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Then he&#8217;s a rogue and a passy measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Away with him. Who hath made this havoc with them?</verseline>
<character>Aguecheek</character>
<prose>I&#8217;ll help you, Sir Toby, because we&#8217;ll be dress&#8217;d together</prose>
<character>Sir Toby</character>
<prose>Will you help- an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave, a thin fac&#8217;d knave, a gull?</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look&#8217;d to</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt Clown, Fabian, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew</stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Enter Sebastian</stage_directions>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;</verseline>
<verseline>But, had it been the brother of my blood,</verseline>
<verseline>I must have done no less with wit and safety</verseline>
<verseline>You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that</verseline>
<verseline>I do perceive it hath offended you</verseline>
<verseline>Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows</verseline>
<verseline>We made each other but so late ago</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!</verseline>
<verseline>A natural perspective, that is and is not</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>Antonio, O my dear Antonio!</verseline>
<verseline>How have the hours rack&#8217;d and tortur&#8217;d me</verseline>
<verseline>Since I have lost thee!</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>Sebastian are you?</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>Fear&#8217;st thou that, Antonio?</verseline>
<character>Antonio</character>
<verseline>How have you made division of yourself?</verseline>
<verseline>An apple cleft in two is not more twin</verseline>
<verseline>Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Most wonderful!</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>Do I stand there? I never had a brother;</verseline>
<verseline>Nor can there be that deity in my nature</verseline>
<verseline>Of here and everywhere. I had a sister</verseline>
<verseline>Whom the blind waves and surges have devour&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>Of charity, what kin are you to me?</verseline>
<verseline>What countryman, what name, what parentage?</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>Of Messaline; Sebastian was my father</verseline>
<verseline>Such a Sebastian was my brother too;</verseline>
<verseline>So went he suited to his watery tomb;</verseline>
<verseline>If spirits can assume both form and suit,</verseline>
<verseline>You come to fright us</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>A spirit I am indeed,</verseline>
<verseline>But am in that dimension grossly clad</verseline>
<verseline>Which from the womb I did participate</verseline>
<verseline>Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,</verseline>
<verseline>I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,</verseline>
<verseline>And say &#8216;Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!&#8217;</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>My father had a mole upon his brow</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>And so had mine</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>And died that day when Viola from her birth</verseline>
<verseline>Had numb&#8217;red thirteen years</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>O, that record is lively in my soul!</verseline>
<verseline>He finished indeed his mortal act</verseline>
<verseline>That day that made my sister thirteen years</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>If nothing lets to make us happy both</verseline>
<verseline>But this my masculine usurp&#8217;d attire,</verseline>
<verseline>Do not embrace me till each circumstance</verseline>
<verseline>Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump</verseline>
<verseline>That I am Viola; which to confirm,</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll bring you to a captain in this town,</verseline>
<verseline>Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help</verseline>
<verseline>I was preserv&#8217;d to serve this noble Count</verseline>
<verseline>All the occurrence of my fortune since</verseline>
<verseline>Hath been between this lady and this lord</verseline>
<character>Sebastian</character>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[To Olivia]</stage_directions_inline> So Comes it, lady, you have been mistook;</verseline>
<verseline>But nature to her bias drew in that</verseline>
<verseline>You would have been contracted to a maid;</verseline>
<verseline>Nor are you therein, by my life, deceiv&#8217;d;</verseline>
<verseline>You are betroth&#8217;d both to a maid and man</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Be not amaz&#8217;d; right noble is his blood</verseline>
<verseline>If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,</verseline>
<verseline>I shall have share in this most happy wreck</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[To Viola]</stage_directions_inline> Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times</verseline>
<verseline>Thou never shouldst love woman like to me</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>And all those sayings will I overswear;</verseline>
<verseline>And all those swearings keep as true in soul</verseline>
<verseline>As doth that orbed continent the fire</verseline>
<verseline>That severs day from night</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Give me thy hand;</verseline>
<verseline>And let me see thee in thy woman&#8217;s weeds</verseline>
<character>Viola</character>
<verseline>The captain that did bring me first on shore</verseline>
<verseline>Hath my maid&#8217;s garments. He, upon some action,</verseline>
<verseline>Is now in durance, at Malvolio&#8217;s suit,</verseline>
<verseline>A gentleman and follower of my lady&#8217;s</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>He shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither;</verseline>
<verseline>And yet, alas, now I remember me,</verseline>
<verseline>They say, poor gentleman, he&#8217;s much distract</verseline>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Clown, with a letter, and Fabian</stage_directions>
<verseline>A most extracting frenzy of mine own</verseline>
<verseline>From my remembrance clearly banish&#8217;d his</verseline>
<verseline>How does he, sirrah?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave&#8217;s end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here writ a letter to you; I should have given &#8216;t you to-day morning, but as a madman&#8217;s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are deliver&#8217;d</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Open&#8217;t, and read it</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman. <stage_directions_inline>[Reads madly ]</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;By the Lord, madam-&#8217;</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>How now! Art thou mad?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>No, madam, I do but read madness. An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow vox</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Prithee read i&#8217; thy right wits</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to read thus; therefore perpend, my Princess, and give ear</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[To Fabian]</stage_directions_inline> Read it you, sirrah</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<prose>
<stage_directions_inline>[Reads]</stage_directions_inline> &#8216;By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of, and speak out of my injury. The Madly-Us&#8217;D Malvolio&#8217;</prose>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Did he write this?</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<verseline>Ay, Madam</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>This savours not much of distraction</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>See him deliver&#8217;d, Fabian; bring him hither</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Fabian</stage_directions>
<verseline>My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,</verseline>
<verseline>To think me as well a sister as a wife,</verseline>
<verseline>One day shall crown th&#8217; alliance on&#8217;t, so please you,</verseline>
<verseline>Here at my house, and at my proper cost</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Madam, I am most apt t&#8217; embrace your offer</verseline>
<verseline>
<stage_directions_inline>[To Viola]</stage_directions_inline>
</verseline>
<verseline>Your master quits you; and, for your service done him,</verseline>
<verseline>So much against the mettle of your sex,</verseline>
<verseline>So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,</verseline>
<verseline>And since you call&#8217;d me master for so long,</verseline>
<verseline>Here is my hand; you shall from this time be</verseline>
<verseline>You master&#8217;s mistress</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>A sister! You are she</verseline>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Fabian, with Malvolio</stage_directions>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Is this the madman?</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Ay, my lord, this same</verseline>
<verseline>How now, Malvolio!</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Madam, you have done me wrong,</verseline>
<verseline>Notorious wrong</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Have I, Malvolio? No</verseline>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter</verseline>
<verseline>You must not now deny it is your hand;</verseline>
<verseline>Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase;</verseline>
<verseline>Or say &#8216;tis not your seal, not your invention;</verseline>
<verseline>You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,</verseline>
<verseline>And tell me, in the modesty of honour,</verseline>
<verseline>Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,</verseline>
<verseline>Bade me come smiling and cross-garter&#8217;d to you,</verseline>
<verseline>To put on yellow stockings, and to frown</verseline>
<verseline>Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;</verseline>
<verseline>And, acting this in an obedient hope,</verseline>
<verseline>Why have you suffer&#8217;d me to be imprison&#8217;d,</verseline>
<verseline>Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</verseline>
<verseline>And made the most notorious geck and gul</verseline>
<verseline>That e&#8217;er invention play&#8217;d on? Tell me why</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</verseline>
<verseline>Though, I confess, much like the character;</verseline>
<verseline>But out of question &#8216;tis Maria&#8217;s hand</verseline>
<verseline>And now I do bethink me, it was she</verseline>
<verseline>First told me thou wast mad; then cam&#8217;st in smiling,</verseline>
<verseline>And in such forms which here were presuppos&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content;</verseline>
<verseline>This practice hath most shrewdly pass&#8217;d upon thee,</verseline>
<verseline>But, when we know the grounds and authors of it,</verseline>
<verseline>Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</verseline>
<verseline>Of thine own cause</verseline>
<character>Fabian</character>
<verseline>Good madam, hear me speak,</verseline>
<verseline>And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come</verseline>
<verseline>Taint the condition of this present hour,</verseline>
<verseline>Which I have wond&#8217;red at. In hope it shall not,</verseline>
<verseline>Most freely I confess myself and Toby</verseline>
<verseline>Set this device against Malvolio here,</verseline>
<verseline>Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts</verseline>
<verseline>We had conceiv&#8217;d against him. Maria writ</verseline>
<verseline>The letter, at Sir Toby&#8217;s great importance,</verseline>
<verseline>In recompense whereof he hath married her</verseline>
<verseline>How with a sportful malice it was follow&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,</verseline>
<verseline>If that the injuries be justly weigh&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>That have on both sides pass&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>Alas, poor fool, how have they baffl&#8217;d thee!</verseline>
<character>Clown</character>
<prose>Why, &#8216;Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.&#8217; I was one, sir, in this interlude- one Sir Topas, sir; but that&#8217;s all one. &#8216;By the Lord, fool, I am not mad!&#8217; But do you remember- &#8216;Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? An you smile not, he&#8217;s gagg&#8217;d&#8217;? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges</prose>
<character>Malvolio</character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll be reveng&#8217;d on the whole pack of you</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions>
<character>Olivia</character>
<verseline>He hath been most notoriously abus&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Duke</character>
<verseline>Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace;</verseline>
<verseline>He hath not told us of the captain yet</verseline>
<verseline>When that is known, and golden time convents,</verseline>
<verseline>A solemn combination shall be made</verseline>
<verseline>Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,</verseline>
<verseline>We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;</verseline>
<verseline>For so you shall be while you are a man;</verseline>
<verseline>But when in other habits you are seen,</verseline>
<verseline>Orsino&#8217;s mistress, and his fancy&#8217;s queen</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt all but the Clown</stage_directions>
<verseline>Clown sings</verseline>
<verseline>When that I was and a little tiny boy,</verseline>
<verseline>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</verseline>
<verseline>A foolish thing was but a toy,</verseline>
<verseline>For the rain it raineth every day</verseline>
<verseline>But when I came to man&#8217;s estate,</verseline>
<verseline>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,</verseline>
<verseline>For the rain it raineth every day</verseline>
<verseline>But when I came, alas! to wive,</verseline>
<verseline>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</verseline>
<verseline>By swaggering could I never thrive,</verseline>
<verseline>For the rain it raineth every day</verseline>
<verseline>But when I came unto my beds,</verseline>
<verseline>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</verseline>
<verseline>With toss-pots still had drunken heads,</verseline>
<verseline>For the rain it raineth every day</verseline>
<verseline>A great while ago the world begun,</verseline>
<verseline>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</verseline>
<verseline>But that&#8217;s all one, our play is done,</verseline>
<verseline>And we&#8217;ll strive to please you every day</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions>
<verseline>-The End-</verseline>
