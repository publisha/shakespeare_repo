<firstscene>Scene 1</firstscene>
<location>London. A street </location>
<stage_directions>Enter Richard, Duke Of Gloucester, solus </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Now is the winter of our discontent </verseline>
<verseline>Made glorious summer by this sun of York; </verseline>
<verseline>And all the clouds that lour&#8217;d upon our house </verseline>
<verseline>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried</verseline>
<verseline>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; </verseline>
<verseline>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; </verseline>
<verseline>Our stern alarums chang&#8217;d to merry meetings, </verseline>
<verseline>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures</verseline>
<verseline>Grim-visag&#8217;d war hath smooth&#8217;d his wrinkled front, </verseline>
<verseline>And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds </verseline>
<verseline>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, </verseline>
<verseline>He capers nimbly in a lady&#8217;s chamber </verseline>
<verseline>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute</verseline>
<verseline>But I-that am not shap&#8217;d for sportive tricks, </verseline>
<verseline>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>I-that am rudely stamp&#8217;d, and want love&#8217;s majesty </verseline>
<verseline>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>I-that am curtail&#8217;d of this fair proportion, </verseline>
<verseline>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, </verseline>
<verseline>Deform&#8217;d, unfinish&#8217;d, sent before my time </verseline>
<verseline>Into this breathing world scarce half made up, </verseline>
<verseline>And that so lamely and unfashionable </verseline>
<verseline>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, </verseline>
<verseline>Have no delight to pass away the time, </verseline>
<verseline>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun </verseline>
<verseline>And descant on mine own deformity</verseline>
<verseline>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover </verseline>
<verseline>To entertain these fair well-spoken days, </verseline>
<verseline>I am determined to prove a villain </verseline>
<verseline>And hate the idle pleasures of these days</verseline>
<verseline>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, </verseline>
<verseline>By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams, </verseline>
<verseline>To set my brother Clarence and the King </verseline>
<verseline>In deadly hate the one against the other; </verseline>
<verseline>And if King Edward be as true and just </verseline>
<verseline>As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, </verseline>
<verseline>This day should Clarence closely be mew&#8217;d up&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>About a prophecy which says that G </verseline>
<verseline>Of Edward&#8217;s heirs the murderer shall be</verseline>
<verseline>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury </stage_directions>
<verseline>Brother, good day. What means this armed guard </verseline>
<verseline>That waits upon your Grace? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>His Majesty, </verseline>
<verseline>Tend&#8217;ring my person&#8217;s safety, hath appointed </verseline>
<verseline>This conduct to convey me to th&#8217; Tower</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Upon what cause? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Because my name is George</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours: </verseline>
<verseline>He should, for that, commit your godfathers</verseline>
<verseline>O, belike his Majesty hath some intent </verseline>
<verseline>That you should be new-christ&#8217;ned in the Tower</verseline>
<verseline>But what&#8217;s the matter, Clarence? May I know? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest </verseline>
<verseline>As yet I do not; but, as I can learn, </verseline>
<verseline>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams, </verseline>
<verseline>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G, </verseline>
<verseline>And says a wizard told him that by G </verseline>
<verseline>His issue disinherited should be; </verseline>
<verseline>And, for my name of George begins with G, </verseline>
<verseline>It follows in his thought that I am he</verseline>
<verseline>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these </verseline>
<verseline>Hath mov&#8217;d his Highness to commit me now</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Why, this it is when men are rul&#8217;d by women: </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower; </verseline>
<verseline>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, &#8216;tis she </verseline>
<verseline>That tempers him to this extremity</verseline>
<verseline>Was it not she and that good man of worship, </verseline>
<verseline>Antony Woodville, her brother there, </verseline>
<verseline>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower, </verseline>
<verseline>From whence this present day he is delivered? </verseline>
<verseline>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>By heaven, I think there is no man is secure </verseline>
<verseline>But the Queen&#8217;s kindred, and night-walking heralds </verseline>
<verseline>That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore</verseline>
<verseline>Heard you not what an humble suppliant </verseline>
<verseline>Lord Hastings was, for her delivery? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Humbly complaining to her deity </verseline>
<verseline>Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll tell you what-I think it is our way, </verseline>
<verseline>If we will keep in favour with the King, </verseline>
<verseline>To be her men and wear her livery: </verseline>
<verseline>The jealous o&#8217;er-worn widow, and herself, </verseline>
<verseline>Since that our brother dubb&#8217;d them gentlewomen, </verseline>
<verseline>Are mighty gossips in our monarchy</verseline>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>I beseech your Graces both to pardon me: </verseline>
<verseline>His Majesty hath straitly given in charge </verseline>
<verseline>That no man shall have private conference, </verseline>
<verseline>Of what degree soever, with your brother</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Even so; an&#8217;t please your worship, Brakenbury, </verseline>
<verseline>You may partake of any thing we say: </verseline>
<verseline>We speak no treason, man; we say the King </verseline>
<verseline>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen </verseline>
<verseline>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous; </verseline>
<verseline>We say that Shore&#8217;s wife hath a pretty foot, </verseline>
<verseline>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue; </verseline>
<verseline>And that the Queen&#8217;s kindred are made gentlefolks</verseline>
<verseline>How say you, sir? Can you deny all this? </verseline>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>With this, my lord, myself have naught to do</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow, </verseline>
<verseline>He that doth naught with her, excepting one, </verseline>
<verseline>Were best to do it secretly alone</verseline>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>What one, my lord? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me? </verseline>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal </verseline>
<verseline>Forbear your conference with the noble Duke</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>We are the Queen&#8217;s abjects and must obey</verseline>
<verseline>Brother, farewell; I will unto the King; </verseline>
<verseline>And whatsoe&#8217;er you will employ me in&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Were it to call King Edward&#8217;s widow sister&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>I will perform it to enfranchise you</verseline>
<verseline>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood </verseline>
<verseline>Touches me deeper than you can imagine</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>I know it pleaseth neither of us well</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long; </verseline>
<verseline>I will deliver or else lie for you</verseline>
<verseline>Meantime, have patience</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>I must perforce. Farewell</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt Clarence, Brakenbury, and guard </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Go tread the path that thou shalt ne&#8217;er return</verseline>
<verseline>Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so </verseline>
<verseline>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven, </verseline>
<verseline>If heaven will take the present at our hands</verseline>
<verseline>But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings? </verseline>
<stage_directions> Enter Lord Hastings </stage_directions>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Good time of day unto my gracious lord! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain! </verseline>
<verseline>Well are you welcome to the open air</verseline>
<verseline>How hath your lordship brook&#8217;d imprisonment? </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must; </verseline>
<verseline>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks </verseline>
<verseline>That were the cause of my imprisonment</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too; </verseline>
<verseline>For they that were your enemies are his, </verseline>
<verseline>And have prevail&#8217;d as much on him as you</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>More pity that the eagles should be mew&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>What news abroad? </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>No news so bad abroad as this at home: </verseline>
<verseline>The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy, </verseline>
<verseline>And his physicians fear him mightily</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed</verseline>
<verseline>O, he hath kept an evil diet long </verseline>
<verseline>And overmuch consum&#8217;d his royal person! </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis very grievous to be thought upon</verseline>
<verseline>Where is he? In his bed? </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>He is</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Go you before, and I will follow you</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Hastings </stage_directions>
<verseline>He cannot live, I hope, and must not die </verseline>
<verseline>Till George be pack&#8217;d with posthorse up to heaven</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence </verseline>
<verseline>With lies well steel&#8217;d with weighty arguments; </verseline>
<verseline>And, if I fail not in my deep intent, </verseline>
<verseline>Clarence hath not another day to live; </verseline>
<verseline>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy, </verseline>
<verseline>And leave the world for me to bustle in! </verseline>
<verseline>For then I&#8217;ll marry Warwick&#8217;s youngest daughter</verseline>
<verseline>What though I kill&#8217;d her husband and her father? </verseline>
<verseline>The readiest way to make the wench amends </verseline>
<verseline>Is to become her husband and her father; </verseline>
<verseline>The which will I-not all so much for love </verseline>
<verseline>As for another secret close intent </verseline>
<verseline>By marrying her which I must reach unto</verseline>
<verseline>But yet I run before my horse to market</verseline>
<verseline>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns; </verseline>
<verseline>When they are gone, then must I count my gains </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<scene>Scene 2</scene>
<location>London. Another street </location>
<stage_directions>Enter corpse of King Henry The Sixth, with halberds to guard it; Lady Anne being the mourner, attended by Tressel and Berkeley </stage_directions>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Set down, set down your honourable load&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>If honour may be shrouded in a hearse; </verseline>
<verseline>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament </verseline>
<verseline>Th&#8217; untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster</verseline>
<verseline>Poor key-cold figure of a holy king! </verseline>
<verseline>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster! </verseline>
<verseline>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood! </verseline>
<verseline>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost </verseline>
<verseline>To hear the lamentations of poor Anne, </verseline>
<verseline>Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son, </verseline>
<verseline>Stabb&#8217;d by the self-same hand that made these wounds</verseline>
<verseline>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life </verseline>
<verseline>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes</verseline>
<verseline>O, cursed be the hand that made these holes! </verseline>
<verseline>Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it! </verseline>
<verseline>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence! </verseline>
<verseline>More direful hap betide that hated wretch </verseline>
<verseline>That makes us wretched by the death of thee </verseline>
<verseline>Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads, </verseline>
<verseline>Or any creeping venom&#8217;d thing that lives! </verseline>
<verseline>If ever he have child, abortive be it, </verseline>
<verseline>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect </verseline>
<verseline>May fright the hopeful mother at the view, </verseline>
<verseline>And that be heir to his unhappiness! </verseline>
<verseline>If ever he have wife, let her be made </verseline>
<verseline>More miserable by the death of him </verseline>
<verseline>Than I am made by my young lord and thee! </verseline>
<verseline>Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load, </verseline>
<verseline>Taken from Paul&#8217;s to be interred there; </verseline>
<verseline>And still as you are weary of this weight </verseline>
<verseline>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry&#8217;s corse</verseline>
<verseline>[The bearers take up the coffin] </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Gloucester </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>What black magician conjures up this fiend </verseline>
<verseline>To stop devoted charitable deeds? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll make a corse of him that disobeys! </verseline>
<character>First Gentleman </character>
<verseline>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command</verseline>
<verseline>Advance thy halberd higher than my breast, </verseline>
<verseline>Or, by Saint Paul, I&#8217;ll strike thee to my foot </verseline>
<verseline>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness</verseline>
<verseline>[The bearers set down the coffin] </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid? </verseline>
<verseline>Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal, </verseline>
<verseline>And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil</verseline>
<verseline>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell! </verseline>
<verseline>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body, </verseline>
<verseline>His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Foul devil, for God&#8217;s sake, hence and trouble us not; </verseline>
<verseline>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell </verseline>
<verseline>Fill&#8217;d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims</verseline>
<verseline>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds, </verseline>
<verseline>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries</verseline>
<verseline>O, gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry&#8217;s wounds </verseline>
<verseline>Open their congeal&#8217;d mouths and bleed afresh</verseline>
<verseline>Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity, </verseline>
<verseline>For &#8216;tis thy presence that exhales this blood </verseline>
<verseline>From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells; </verseline>
<verseline>Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural </verseline>
<verseline>Provokes this deluge most unnatural</verseline>
<verseline>O God, which this blood mad&#8217;st, revenge his death! </verseline>
<verseline>O earth, which this blood drink&#8217;st, revenge his death! </verseline>
<verseline>Either, heav&#8217;n, with lightning strike the murd&#8217;rer dead; </verseline>
<verseline>Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick, </verseline>
<verseline>As thou dost swallow up this good king&#8217;s blood, </verseline>
<verseline>Which his hell-govern&#8217;d arm hath butchered</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Lady, you know no rules of charity, </verseline>
<verseline>Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man: </verseline>
<verseline>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>But I know none, and therefore am no beast</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>O wonderful, when devils tell the truth! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>More wonderful when angels are so angry</verseline>
<verseline>Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, </verseline>
<verseline>Of these supposed crimes to give me leave </verseline>
<verseline>By circumstance but to acquit myself</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Vouchsafe, diffus&#8217;d infection of a man, </verseline>
<verseline>Of these known evils but to give me leave </verseline>
<verseline>By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have </verseline>
<verseline>Some patient leisure to excuse myself</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make </verseline>
<verseline>No excuse current but to hang thyself</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>By such despair I should accuse myself</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>And by despairing shalt thou stand excused </verseline>
<verseline>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself </verseline>
<verseline>That didst unworthy slaughter upon others</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Say that I slew them not? </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Then say they were not slain</verseline>
<verseline>But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I did not kill your husband</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Why, then he is alive</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward&#8217;s hands</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw </verseline>
<verseline>Thy murd&#8217;rous falchion smoking in his blood; </verseline>
<verseline>The which thou once didst bend against her breast, </verseline>
<verseline>But that thy brothers beat aside the point</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I was provoked by her sland&#8217;rous tongue </verseline>
<verseline>That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind, </verseline>
<verseline>That never dream&#8217;st on aught but butcheries</verseline>
<verseline>Didst thou not kill this king? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I grant ye</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to </verseline>
<verseline>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed! </verseline>
<verseline>O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>The better for the King of Heaven, that hath him</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Let him thank me that holp to send him thither, </verseline>
<verseline>For he was fitter for that place than earth</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>And thou unfit for any place but hell</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Some dungeon</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Your bed-chamber</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>So will it, madam, till I lie with you</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>I hope so</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne, </verseline>
<verseline>To leave this keen encounter of our wits, </verseline>
<verseline>And fall something into a slower method- </verseline>
<verseline>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths </verseline>
<verseline>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward, </verseline>
<verseline>As blameful as the executioner? </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Thou wast the cause and most accurs&#8217;d effect</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Your beauty was the cause of that effect- </verseline>
<verseline>Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep </verseline>
<verseline>To undertake the death of all the world </verseline>
<verseline>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide, </verseline>
<verseline>These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>These eyes could not endure that beauty&#8217;s wreck; </verseline>
<verseline>You should not blemish it if I stood by</verseline>
<verseline>As all the world is cheered by the sun, </verseline>
<verseline>So I by that; it is my day, my life</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Black night o&#8217;ershade thy day, and death thy life! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>I would I were, to be reveng&#8217;d on thee</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>It is a quarrel most unnatural, </verseline>
<verseline>To be reveng&#8217;d on him that loveth thee</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>It is a quarrel just and reasonable, </verseline>
<verseline>To be reveng&#8217;d on him that kill&#8217;d my husband</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband </verseline>
<verseline>Did it to help thee to a better husband</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>His better doth not breathe upon the earth</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>He lives that loves thee better than he could</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Name him</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Plantagenet</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Why, that was he</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>The self-same name, but one of better nature</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Where is he? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Here. [She spits at him] Why dost thou spit at me? </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Never came poison from so sweet a place</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Never hung poison on a fouler toad</verseline>
<verseline>Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I would they were, that I might die at once; </verseline>
<verseline>For now they kill me with a living death</verseline>
<verseline>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears, </verseline>
<verseline>Sham&#8217;d their aspects with store of childish drops&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear, </verseline>
<verseline>No, when my father York and Edward wept </verseline>
<verseline>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made </verseline>
<verseline>When black-fac&#8217;d Clifford shook his sword at him; </verseline>
<verseline>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child, </verseline>
<verseline>Told the sad story of my father&#8217;s death, </verseline>
<verseline>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep </verseline>
<verseline>That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks </verseline>
<verseline>Like trees bedash&#8217;d with rain-in that sad time </verseline>
<verseline>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear; </verseline>
<verseline>And what these sorrows could not thence exhale </verseline>
<verseline>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping</verseline>
<verseline>I never sued to friend nor enemy; </verseline>
<verseline>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word; </verseline>
<verseline>But, now thy beauty is propos&#8217;d my fee, </verseline>
<verseline>My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak</verseline>
<verseline>[She looks scornfully at him] </verseline>
<verseline>Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made </verseline>
<verseline>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt</verseline>
<verseline>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, </verseline>
<verseline>Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword; </verseline>
<verseline>Which if thou please to hide in this true breast </verseline>
<verseline>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, </verseline>
<verseline>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke, </verseline>
<verseline>And humbly beg the death upon my knee</verseline>
<verseline>[He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword] </verseline>
<verseline>Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>But &#8216;twas thy beauty that provoked me</verseline>
<verseline>Nay, now dispatch; &#8216;twas I that stabb&#8217;d young Edward- </verseline>
<verseline>But &#8216;twas thy heavenly face that set me on</verseline>
<verseline>[She falls the sword] </verseline>
<verseline>Take up the sword again, or take up me</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death, </verseline>
<verseline>I will not be thy executioner</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it; </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>I have already</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>That was in thy rage</verseline>
<verseline>Speak it again, and even with the word </verseline>
<verseline>This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love, </verseline>
<verseline>Shall for thy love kill a far truer love; </verseline>
<verseline>To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>I would I knew thy heart</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis figur&#8217;d in my tongue</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>I fear me both are false</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Then never was man true</verseline>
<character>Anne  </character>
<verseline>Well put up your sword</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Say, then, my peace is made</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>That shalt thou know hereafter</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>But shall I live in hope? </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>All men, I hope, live so</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Vouchsafe to wear this ring</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>To take is not to give</verseline>
<verseline>[Puts on the ring] </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger, </verseline>
<verseline>Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart; </verseline>
<verseline>Wear both of them, for both of them are thine</verseline>
<verseline>And if thy poor devoted servant may </verseline>
<verseline>But beg one favour at thy gracious hand, </verseline>
<verseline>Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>What is it? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>That it may please you leave these sad designs </verseline>
<verseline>To him that hath most cause to be a mourner, </verseline>
<verseline>And presently repair to Crosby House; </verseline>
<verseline>Where-after I have solemnly interr&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>At Chertsey monast&#8217;ry this noble king, </verseline>
<verseline>And wet his grave with my repentant tears&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>I will with all expedient duty see you</verseline>
<verseline>For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you, </verseline>
<verseline>Grant me this boon</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>With all my heart; and much it joys me too </verseline>
<verseline>To see you are become so penitent</verseline>
<verseline>Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Bid me farewell</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis more than you deserve; </verseline>
<verseline>But since you teach me how to flatter you, </verseline>
<verseline>Imagine I have said farewell already</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt two Gentlemen With Lady Anne </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Sirs, take up the corse</verseline>
<character>Gentlemen </character>
<verseline>Towards Chertsey, noble lord? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>No, to White Friars; there attend my coming</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt all but Gloucester </stage_directions>
<verseline>Was ever woman in this humour woo&#8217;d? </verseline>
<verseline>Was ever woman in this humour won? </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll have her; but I will not keep her long</verseline>
<verseline>What! I that kill&#8217;d her husband and his father&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>To take her in her heart&#8217;s extremest hate, </verseline>
<verseline>With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes, </verseline>
<verseline>The bleeding witness of my hatred by; </verseline>
<verseline>Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me, </verseline>
<verseline>And I no friends to back my suit at all </verseline>
<verseline>But the plain devil and dissembling looks, </verseline>
<verseline>And yet to win her, all the world to nothing! </verseline>
<verseline>Ha! </verseline>
<verseline>Hath she forgot already that brave prince, </verseline>
<verseline>Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since, </verseline>
<verseline>Stabb&#8217;d in my angry mood at Tewksbury? </verseline>
<verseline>A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Fram&#8217;d in the prodigality of nature, </verseline>
<verseline>Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>The spacious world cannot again afford; </verseline>
<verseline>And will she yet abase her eyes on me, </verseline>
<verseline>That cropp&#8217;d the golden prime of this sweet prince </verseline>
<verseline>And made her widow to a woeful bed? </verseline>
<verseline>On me, whose all not equals Edward&#8217;s moiety? </verseline>
<verseline>On me, that halts and am misshapen thus? </verseline>
<verseline>My dukedom to a beggarly denier, </verseline>
<verseline>I do mistake my person all this while</verseline>
<verseline>Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot, </verseline>
<verseline>Myself to be a marv&#8217;llous proper man</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll be at charges for a looking-glass, </verseline>
<verseline>And entertain a score or two of tailors </verseline>
<verseline>To study fashions to adorn my body</verseline>
<verseline>Since I am crept in favour with myself, </verseline>
<verseline>I will maintain it with some little cost</verseline>
<verseline>But first I&#8217;ll turn yon fellow in his grave, </verseline>
<verseline>And then return lamenting to my love</verseline>
<verseline>Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, </verseline>
<verseline>That I may see my shadow as I pass</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<scene>Scene 3</scene>
<location> London. The palace </location>
<stage_directions>Enter Queen Elizabeth, Lord Rivers, and Lord Grey </stage_directions>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>Have patience, madam; there&#8217;s no doubt his Majesty </verseline>
<verseline>Will soon recover his accustom&#8217;d health</verseline>
<character>Grey </character>
<verseline>In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse; </verseline>
<verseline>Therefore, for God&#8217;s sake, entertain good comfort, </verseline>
<verseline>And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>If he were dead, what would betide on me? </verseline>
<character>Grey </character>
<verseline>No other harm but loss of such a lord</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>The loss of such a lord includes all harms</verseline>
<character>Grey </character>
<verseline>The heavens have bless&#8217;d you with a goodly son </verseline>
<verseline>To be your comforter when he is gone</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Ah, he is young; and his minority </verseline>
<verseline>Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, </verseline>
<verseline>A man that loves not me, nor none of you</verseline>
<character>River </character>
<verseline>Is it concluded he shall be Protector? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>It is determin&#8217;d, not concluded yet; </verseline>
<verseline>But so it must be, if the King miscarry</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Buckingham and Derby </stage_directions>
<character>Grey </character>
<verseline>Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Good time of day unto your royal Grace! </verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>God make your Majesty joyful as you have been</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby, </verseline>
<verseline>To your good prayer will scarcely say amen</verseline>
<verseline>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she&#8217;s your wife </verseline>
<verseline>And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>I hate not you for her proud arrogance</verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>I do beseech you, either not believe </verseline>
<verseline>The envious slanders of her false accusers; </verseline>
<verseline>Or, if she be accus&#8217;d on true report, </verseline>
<verseline>Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds </verseline>
<verseline>From wayward sickness and no grounded malice</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of Derby? </verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I </verseline>
<verseline>Are come from visiting his Majesty</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>What likelihood of his amendment, Lords? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks cheerfully</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>God grant him health! Did you confer with him? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement </verseline>
<verseline>Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers, </verseline>
<verseline>And between them and my Lord Chamberlain; </verseline>
<verseline>And sent to warn them to his royal presence</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Would all were well! But that will never be</verseline>
<verseline>I fear our happiness is at the height</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Gloucester, Hastings, and Dorset </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it</verseline>
<verseline>Who is it that complains unto the King </verseline>
<verseline>That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not? </verseline>
<verseline>By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly </verseline>
<verseline>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours</verseline>
<verseline>Because I cannot flatter and look fair, </verseline>
<verseline>Smile in men&#8217;s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog, </verseline>
<verseline>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy, </verseline>
<verseline>I must be held a rancorous enemy</verseline>
<verseline>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm </verseline>
<verseline>But thus his simple truth must be abus&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks? </verseline>
<character>Grey </character>
<verseline>To who in all this presence speaks your Grace? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace</verseline>
<verseline>When have I injur&#8217;d thee? when done thee wrong, </verseline>
<verseline>Or thee, or thee, or any of your faction? </verseline>
<verseline>A plague upon you all! His royal Grace&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Whom God preserve better than you would wish!&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while </verseline>
<verseline>But you must trouble him with lewd complaints</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter</verseline>
<verseline>The King, on his own royal disposition </verseline>
<verseline>And not provok&#8217;d by any suitor else- </verseline>
<verseline>Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred </verseline>
<verseline>That in your outward action shows itself </verseline>
<verseline>Against my children, brothers, and myself&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Makes him to send that he may learn the ground</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad </verseline>
<verseline>That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch</verseline>
<verseline>Since every Jack became a gentleman, </verseline>
<verseline>There&#8217;s many a gentle person made a Jack</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester: </verseline>
<verseline>You envy my advancement and my friends&#8217;; </verseline>
<verseline>God grant we never may have need of you! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Meantime, God grants that I have need of you</verseline>
<verseline>Our brother is imprison&#8217;d by your means, </verseline>
<verseline>Myself disgrac&#8217;d, and the nobility </verseline>
<verseline>Held in contempt; while great promotions </verseline>
<verseline>Are daily given to ennoble those </verseline>
<verseline>That scarce some two days since were worth a noble</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>By Him that rais&#8217;d me to this careful height </verseline>
<verseline>From that contented hap which I enjoy&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>I never did incense his Majesty </verseline>
<verseline>Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been </verseline>
<verseline>An earnest advocate to plead for him</verseline>
<verseline>My lord, you do me shameful injury </verseline>
<verseline>Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>You may deny that you were not the mean </verseline>
<verseline>Of my Lord Hastings&#8217; late imprisonment</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>She may, my lord; for&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows not so? </verseline>
<verseline>She may do more, sir, than denying that: </verseline>
<verseline>She may help you to many fair preferments </verseline>
<verseline>And then deny her aiding hand therein, </verseline>
<verseline>And lay those honours on your high desert</verseline>
<verseline>What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>What, marry, may she? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>What, marry, may she? Marry with a king, </verseline>
<verseline>A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too</verseline>
<verseline>Iwis your grandam had a worser match</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne </verseline>
<verseline>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs</verseline>
<verseline>By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty </verseline>
<verseline>Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>I had rather be a country servant-maid </verseline>
<verseline>Than a great queen with this condition- </verseline>
<verseline>To be so baited, scorn&#8217;d, and stormed at</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter old Queen Margaret, behind </stage_directions>
<verseline>Small joy have I in being England&#8217;s Queen</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>And less&#8217;ned be that small, God, I beseech Him! </verseline>
<verseline>Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>What! Threat you me with telling of the King? </verseline>
<verseline>Tell him and spare not. Look what I have said </verseline>
<verseline>I will avouch&#8217;t in presence of the King</verseline>
<verseline>I dare adventure to be sent to th&#8217; Tow&#8217;r</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Out, devil! I do remember them to well: </verseline>
<verseline>Thou kill&#8217;dst my husband Henry in the Tower, </verseline>
<verseline>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband King, </verseline>
<verseline>I was a pack-horse in his great affairs, </verseline>
<verseline>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries, </verseline>
<verseline>A liberal rewarder of his friends; </verseline>
<verseline>To royalize his blood I spent mine own</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Ay, and much better blood than his or thine</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>In all which time you and your husband Grey </verseline>
<verseline>Were factious for the house of Lancaster; </verseline>
<verseline>And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband </verseline>
<verseline>In Margaret&#8217;s battle at Saint Albans slain? </verseline>
<verseline>Let me put in your minds, if you forget, </verseline>
<verseline>What you have been ere this, and what you are; </verseline>
<verseline>Withal, what I have been, and what I am</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>A murd&#8217;rous villain, and so still thou art</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick, </verseline>
<verseline>Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Which God revenge! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>To fight on Edward&#8217;s party for the crown; </verseline>
<verseline>And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up</verseline>
<verseline>I would to God my heart were flint like Edward&#8217;s, </verseline>
<verseline>Or Edward&#8217;s soft and pitiful like mine</verseline>
<verseline>I am too childish-foolish for this world</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this world, </verseline>
<verseline>Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days </verseline>
<verseline>Which here you urge to prove us enemies, </verseline>
<verseline>We follow&#8217;d then our lord, our sovereign king</verseline>
<verseline>So should we you, if you should be our king</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar</verseline>
<verseline>Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof! </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>As little joy, my lord, as you suppose </verseline>
<verseline>You should enjoy were you this country&#8217;s king, </verseline>
<verseline>As little joy you may suppose in me </verseline>
<verseline>That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof; </verseline>
<verseline>For I am she, and altogether joyless</verseline>
<verseline>I can no longer hold me patient</verseline>
<verseline>[Advancing] </verseline>
<verseline>Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out </verseline>
<verseline>In sharing that which you have pill&#8217;d from me</verseline>
<verseline>Which of you trembles not that looks on me? </verseline>
<verseline>If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects, </verseline>
<verseline>Yet that, by you depos&#8217;d, you quake like rebels? </verseline>
<verseline>Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Foul wrinkled witch, what mak&#8217;st thou in my sight? </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>But repetition of what thou hast marr&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>That will I make before I let thee go</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Wert thou not banished on pain of death? </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>I was; but I do find more pain in banishment </verseline>
<verseline>Than death can yield me here by my abode</verseline>
<verseline>A husband and a son thou ow&#8217;st to me; </verseline>
<verseline>And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance</verseline>
<verseline>This sorrow that I have by right is yours; </verseline>
<verseline>And all the pleasures you usurp are mine</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>The curse my noble father laid on thee, </verseline>
<verseline>When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper </verseline>
<verseline>And with thy scorns drew&#8217;st rivers from his eyes, </verseline>
<verseline>And then to dry them gav&#8217;st the Duke a clout </verseline>
<verseline>Steep&#8217;d in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>His curses then from bitterness of soul </verseline>
<verseline>Denounc&#8217;d against thee are all fall&#8217;n upon thee; </verseline>
<verseline>And God, not we, hath plagu&#8217;d thy bloody deed</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>So just is God to right the innocent</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>O, &#8216;twas the foulest deed to slay that babe, </verseline>
<verseline>And the most merciless that e&#8217;er was heard of! </verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported</verseline>
<character>Dorset </character>
<verseline>No man but prophesied revenge for it</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Northumberland, then present, wept to see it</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>What, were you snarling all before I came, </verseline>
<verseline>Ready to catch each other by the throat, </verseline>
<verseline>And turn you all your hatred now on me? </verseline>
<verseline>Did York&#8217;s dread curse prevail so much with heaven </verseline>
<verseline>That Henry&#8217;s death, my lovely Edward&#8217;s death, </verseline>
<verseline>Their kingdom&#8217;s loss, my woeful banishment, </verseline>
<verseline>Should all but answer for that peevish brat? </verseline>
<verseline>Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? </verseline>
<verseline>Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses! </verseline>
<verseline>Though not by war, by surfeit die your king, </verseline>
<verseline>As ours by murder, to make him a king! </verseline>
<verseline>Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales, </verseline>
<verseline>For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales, </verseline>
<verseline>Die in his youth by like untimely violence! </verseline>
<verseline>Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen, </verseline>
<verseline>Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self! </verseline>
<verseline>Long mayest thou live to wail thy children&#8217;s death, </verseline>
<verseline>And see another, as I see thee now, </verseline>
<verseline>Deck&#8217;d in thy rights, as thou art stall&#8217;d in mine! </verseline>
<verseline>Long die thy happy days before thy death; </verseline>
<verseline>And, after many length&#8217;ned hours of grief, </verseline>
<verseline>Die neither mother, wife, nor England&#8217;s Queen! </verseline>
<verseline>Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by, </verseline>
<verseline>And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son </verseline>
<verseline>Was stabb&#8217;d with bloody daggers. God, I pray him, </verseline>
<verseline>That none of you may live his natural age, </verseline>
<verseline>But by some unlook&#8217;d accident cut off! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither&#8217;d hag</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me</verseline>
<verseline>If heaven have any grievous plague in store </verseline>
<verseline>Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee, </verseline>
<verseline>O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe, </verseline>
<verseline>And then hurl down their indignation </verseline>
<verseline>On thee, the troubler of the poor world&#8217;s peace! </verseline>
<verseline>The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul! </verseline>
<verseline>Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv&#8217;st, </verseline>
<verseline>And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends! </verseline>
<verseline>No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine, </verseline>
<verseline>Unless it be while some tormenting dream </verseline>
<verseline>Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils! </verseline>
<verseline>Thou elvish-mark&#8217;d, abortive, rooting hog, </verseline>
<verseline>Thou that wast seal&#8217;d in thy nativity </verseline>
<verseline>The slave of nature and the son of hell, </verseline>
<verseline>Thou slander of thy heavy mother&#8217;s womb, </verseline>
<verseline>Thou loathed issue of thy father&#8217;s loins, </verseline>
<verseline>Thou rag of honour, thou detested&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Margaret! </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Richard! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Ha? </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>I call thee not</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I cry thee mercy then, for I did think </verseline>
<verseline>That thou hadst call&#8217;d me all these bitter names</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Why, so I did, but look&#8217;d for no reply</verseline>
<verseline>O, let me make the period to my curse! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Thus have you breath&#8217;d your curse against yourself</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune! </verseline>
<verseline>Why strew&#8217;st thou sugar on that bottled spider </verseline>
<verseline>Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about? </verseline>
<verseline>Fool, fool! thou whet&#8217;st a knife to kill thyself</verseline>
<verseline>The day will come that thou shalt wish for me </verseline>
<verseline>To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back&#8217;d toad</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse, </verseline>
<verseline>Lest to thy harm thou move our patience</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Foul shame upon you! you have all mov&#8217;d mine</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>Were you well serv&#8217;d, you would be taught your duty</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>To serve me well you all should do me duty, </verseline>
<verseline>Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects</verseline>
<verseline>O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty! </verseline>
<character>Dorset </character>
<verseline>Dispute not with her; she is lunatic</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert; </verseline>
<verseline>Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current</verseline>
<verseline>O, that your young nobility could judge </verseline>
<verseline>What &#8216;twere to lose it and be miserable! </verseline>
<verseline>They that stand high have many blasts to shake them, </verseline>
<verseline>And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis</verseline>
<character>Dorset </character>
<verseline>It touches you, my lord, as much as me</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Ay, and much more; but I was born so high, </verseline>
<verseline>Our aery buildeth in the cedar&#8217;s top, </verseline>
<verseline>And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas! </verseline>
<verseline>Witness my son, now in the shade of death, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath </verseline>
<verseline>Hath in eternal darkness folded up</verseline>
<verseline>Your aery buildeth in our aery&#8217;s nest</verseline>
<verseline>O God that seest it, do not suffer it; </verseline>
<verseline>As it is won with blood, lost be it so! </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity! </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Urge neither charity nor shame to me</verseline>
<verseline>Uncharitably with me have you dealt, </verseline>
<verseline>And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>My charity is outrage, life my shame; </verseline>
<verseline>And in that shame still live my sorrow&#8217;s rage! </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Have done, have done</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>O princely Buckingham, I&#8217;ll kiss thy hand </verseline>
<verseline>In sign of league and amity with thee</verseline>
<verseline>Now fair befall thee and thy noble house! </verseline>
<verseline>Thy garments are not spotted with our blood, </verseline>
<verseline>Nor thou within the compass of my curse</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Nor no one here; for curses never pass </verseline>
<verseline>The lips of those that breathe them in the air</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>I will not think but they ascend the sky </verseline>
<verseline>And there awake God&#8217;s gentle-sleeping peace</verseline>
<verseline>Obuckingham, take heed of yonder dog! </verseline>
<verseline>Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites, </verseline>
<verseline>His venom tooth will rankle to the death: </verseline>
<verseline>Have not to do with him, beware of him; </verseline>
<verseline>Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him, </verseline>
<verseline>And all their ministers attend on him</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel, </verseline>
<verseline>And soothe the devil that I warn thee from? </verseline>
<verseline>O, but remember this another day, </verseline>
<verseline>When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow, </verseline>
<verseline>And say poor Margaret was a prophetess! </verseline>
<verseline>Live each of you the subjects to his hate, </verseline>
<verseline>And he to yours, and all of you to God&#8217;s! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>And so doth mine. I muse why she&#8217;s at liberty</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I cannot blame her; by God&#8217;s holy Mother, </verseline>
<verseline>She hath had too much wrong; and I repent </verseline>
<verseline>My part thereof that I have done to her</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>I never did her any to my knowledge</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong</verseline>
<verseline>I was too hot to do somebody good </verseline>
<verseline>That is too cold in thinking of it now</verseline>
<verseline>Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid; </verseline>
<verseline>He is frank&#8217;d up to fatting for his pains; </verseline>
<verseline>God pardon them that are the cause thereof! </verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion, </verseline>
<verseline>To pray for them that have done scathe to us! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>So do I ever&#8212; [Aside] being well advis&#8217;d; </verseline>
<verseline>For had I curs&#8217;d now, I had curs&#8217;d myself</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Catesby </stage_directions>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>Madam, his Majesty doth can for you, </verseline>
<verseline>And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go with me? </verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>We wait upon your Grace</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt all but Gloucester </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl</verseline>
<verseline>The secret mischiefs that I set abroach </verseline>
<verseline>I lay unto the grievous charge of others</verseline>
<verseline>Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness, </verseline>
<verseline>I do beweep to many simple gulls; </verseline>
<verseline>Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham; </verseline>
<verseline>And tell them &#8216;tis the Queen and her allies </verseline>
<verseline>That stir the King against the Duke my brother</verseline>
<verseline>Now they believe it, and withal whet me </verseline>
<verseline>To be reveng&#8217;d on Rivers, Dorset, Grey; </verseline>
<verseline>But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture, </verseline>
<verseline>Tell them that God bids us do good for evil</verseline>
<verseline>And thus I clothe my naked villainy </verseline>
<verseline>With odd old ends stol&#8217;n forth of holy writ, </verseline>
<verseline>And seem a saint when most I play the devil</verseline>
<stage_directions> Enter two Murderers </stage_directions>
<verseline>But, soft, here come my executioners</verseline>
<verseline>How now, my hardy stout resolved mates! </verseline>
<verseline>Are you now going to dispatch this thing? </verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant, </verseline>
<verseline>That we may be admitted where he is</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Well thought upon; I have it here about me</verseline>
<verseline>[Gives the warrant] </verseline>
<verseline>When you have done, repair to Crosby Place</verseline>
<verseline>But, sirs, be sudden in the execution, </verseline>
<verseline>Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead; </verseline>
<verseline>For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps </verseline>
<verseline>May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate; </verseline>
<verseline>Talkers are no good doers. Be assur&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>We go to use our hands and not our tongues</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Your eyes drop millstones when fools&#8217; eyes fall tears</verseline>
<verseline>I like you, lads; about your business straight; </verseline>
<verseline>Go, go, dispatch</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>We will, my noble lord</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt </stage_directions>
<scene>Scene 4</scene>
<location>London. The Tower </location>
<stage_directions>Enter Clarence and Keeper </stage_directions>
<character>Keeper </character>
<verseline>Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>O, I have pass&#8217;d a miserable night, </verseline>
<verseline>So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights, </verseline>
<verseline>That, as I am a Christian faithful man, </verseline>
<verseline>I would not spend another such a night </verseline>
<verseline>Though &#8216;twere to buy a world of happy days- </verseline>
<verseline>So full of dismal terror was the time! </verseline>
<character>Keeper </character>
<verseline>What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower </verseline>
<verseline>And was embark&#8217;d to cross to Burgundy; </verseline>
<verseline>And in my company my brother Gloucester, </verseline>
<verseline>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk </verseline>
<verseline>Upon the hatches. Thence we look&#8217;d toward England, </verseline>
<verseline>And cited up a thousand heavy times, </verseline>
<verseline>During the wars of York and Lancaster, </verseline>
<verseline>That had befall&#8217;n us. As we pac&#8217;d along </verseline>
<verseline>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, </verseline>
<verseline>Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling </verseline>
<verseline>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard </verseline>
<verseline>Into the tumbling billows of the main</verseline>
<verseline>Olord, methought what pain it was to drown, </verseline>
<verseline>What dreadful noise of waters in my ears, </verseline>
<verseline>What sights of ugly death within my eyes! </verseline>
<verseline>Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks, </verseline>
<verseline>A thousand men that fishes gnaw&#8217;d upon, </verseline>
<verseline>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, </verseline>
<verseline>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, </verseline>
<verseline>All scatt&#8217;red in the bottom of the sea; </verseline>
<verseline>Some lay in dead men&#8217;s skulls, and in the holes </verseline>
<verseline>Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept, </verseline>
<verseline>As &#8216;twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, </verseline>
<verseline>That woo&#8217;d the slimy bottom of the deep </verseline>
<verseline>And mock&#8217;d the dead bones that lay scatt&#8217;red by</verseline>
<character>Keeper </character>
<verseline>Had you such leisure in the time of death </verseline>
<verseline>To gaze upon these secrets of the deep? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Methought I had; and often did I strive </verseline>
<verseline>To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood </verseline>
<verseline>Stopp&#8217;d in my soul and would not let it forth </verseline>
<verseline>To find the empty, vast, and wand&#8217;ring air; </verseline>
<verseline>But smother&#8217;d it within my panting bulk, </verseline>
<verseline>Who almost burst to belch it in the sea</verseline>
<character>Keeper </character>
<verseline>Awak&#8217;d you not in this sore agony? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>No, no, my dream was lengthen&#8217;d after life</verseline>
<verseline>O, then began the tempest to my soul! </verseline>
<verseline>I pass&#8217;d, methought, the melancholy flood </verseline>
<verseline>With that sour ferryman which poets write of, </verseline>
<verseline>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night</verseline>
<verseline>The first that there did greet my stranger soul </verseline>
<verseline>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick, </verseline>
<verseline>Who spake aloud &#8216;What scourge for perjury </verseline>
<verseline>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?&#8217; </verseline>
<verseline>And so he vanish&#8217;d. Then came wand&#8217;ring by </verseline>
<verseline>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair </verseline>
<verseline>Dabbled in blood, and he shriek&#8217;d out aloud </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur&#8217;d Clarence, </verseline>
<verseline>That stabb&#8217;d me in the field by Tewksbury</verseline>
<verseline>Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!&#8217; </verseline>
<verseline>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends </verseline>
<verseline>Environ&#8217;d me, and howled in mine ears </verseline>
<verseline>Such hideous cries that, with the very noise, </verseline>
<verseline>I trembling wak&#8217;d, and for a season after </verseline>
<verseline>Could not believe but that I was in hell, </verseline>
<verseline>Such terrible impression made my dream</verseline>
<character>Keeper </character>
<verseline>No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you; </verseline>
<verseline>I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things </verseline>
<verseline>That now give evidence against my soul </verseline>
<verseline>For Edward&#8217;s sake, and see how he requites me! </verseline>
<verseline>O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee, </verseline>
<verseline>But Thou wilt be aveng&#8217;d on my misdeeds, </verseline>
<verseline>Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone; </verseline>
<verseline>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children! </verseline>
<character>Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile; </character>
<verseline>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep</verseline>
<character>Keeper </character>
<verseline>I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest</verseline>
<verseline>[Clarence sleeps] </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Brakenbury the Lieutenant </stage_directions>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, </verseline>
<verseline>Makes the night morning and the noontide night</verseline>
<verseline>Princes have but their titles for their glories, </verseline>
<verseline>An outward honour for an inward toil; </verseline>
<verseline>And for unfelt imaginations </verseline>
<verseline>They often feel a world of restless cares, </verseline>
<verseline>So that between their tides and low name </verseline>
<verseline>There&#8217;s nothing differs but the outward fame</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter the two Murderers </stage_directions>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>Ho! who&#8217;s here? </prose>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam&#8217;st thou hither? </verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs</prose>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>What, so brief? </verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>&#8216;Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let him see our commission and talk no more</prose>
<verseline>[Brakenbury reads it] </verseline>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>I am, in this, commanded to deliver </verseline>
<verseline>The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands</verseline>
<verseline>I will not reason what is meant hereby, </verseline>
<verseline>Because I will be guiltless from the meaning</verseline>
<verseline>There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll to the King and signify to him </verseline>
<verseline>That thus I have resign&#8217;d to you my charge</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>You may, sir; &#8216;tis a point of wisdom. Fare you well</prose>
<stage_directions>Exeunt Brakenbury and Keeper </stage_directions>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>What, shall I stab him as he sleeps? </prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>No; he&#8217;ll say &#8216;twas done cowardly, when he wakes</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Why, he shall never wake until the great judgment-day</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>Why, then he&#8217;ll say we stabb&#8217;d him sleeping</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>The urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>What, art thou afraid? </prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to be damn&#8217;d for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>I thought thou hadst been resolute</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>So I am, to let him live</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>I&#8217;ll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>How dost thou feel thyself now? </prose>
<character>Second Murderer</character>
<prose>Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>Remember our reward, when the deed&#8217;s done</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>Where&#8217;s thy conscience now? </prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>O, in the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s purse! </prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>When he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>&#8216;Tis no matter; let it go; there&#8217;s few or none will entertain it</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>What if it come to thee again? </prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>I&#8217;ll not meddle with it-it makes a man coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbour&#8217;s wife, but it detects him. &#8216;Tis a blushing shame-fac&#8217;d spirit that mutinies in a man&#8217;s bosom; it fills a man full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it</prose>
<prose>It is turn&#8217;d out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing; and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>Zounds, &#8216;tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the Duke</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Take the devil in thy mind and believe him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the sigh</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>I am strong-fram&#8217;d; he cannot prevail with me</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation. Come, shall we fall to work? </prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the next room</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>O excellent device! and make a sop of him</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>Soft! he wakes</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Strike! </prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>No, we&#8217;ll reason with him</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine</verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>In God&#8217;s name, what art thou? </verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>A man, as you are</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>But not as I am, royal</verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Nor you as we are, loyal</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>My voice is now the King&#8217;s, my looks mine own</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak! </verseline>
<verseline>Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale? </verseline>
<verseline>Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come? </verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>To, to, to&#8212; </prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>To murder me? </verseline>
<character>Both Murderers </character>
<prose>Ay, ay</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, </verseline>
<verseline>And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it</verseline>
<verseline>Wherein, my friends, have I offended you? </verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>Offended us you have not, but the King</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>I shall be reconcil&#8217;d to him again</verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Are you drawn forth among a world of men </verseline>
<verseline>To slay the innocent? What is my offence? </verseline>
<verseline>Where is the evidence that doth accuse me? </verseline>
<verseline>What lawful quest have given their verdict up </verseline>
<verseline>Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence&#8217; death? </verseline>
<verseline>Before I be convict by course of law, </verseline>
<verseline>To threaten me with death is most unlawful</verseline>
<verseline>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption </verseline>
<verseline>By Christ&#8217;s dear blood shed for our grievous sins, </verseline>
<verseline>That you depart and lay no hands on me</verseline>
<verseline>The deed you undertake is damnable</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<prose>What we will do, we do upon command</prose>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>And he that hath commanded is our King</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings </verseline>
<verseline>Hath in the tables of his law commanded </verseline>
<verseline>That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then </verseline>
<verseline>Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man&#8217;s? </verseline>
<verseline>Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand </verseline>
<verseline>To hurl upon their heads that break his law</verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<verseline>And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee </verseline>
<verseline>For false forswearing, and for murder too; </verseline>
<verseline>Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight </verseline>
<verseline>In quarrel of the house of Lancaster</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>And like a traitor to the name of God </verseline>
<verseline>Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade </verseline>
<verseline>Unripp&#8217;dst the bowels of thy sov&#8217;reign&#8217;s son</verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend</prose>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>How canst thou urge God&#8217;s dreadful law to us, </verseline>
<verseline>When thou hast broke it in such dear degree? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed? </verseline>
<verseline>For Edward, for my brother, for his sake</verseline>
<verseline>He sends you not to murder me for this, </verseline>
<verseline>For in that sin he is as deep as I</verseline>
<verseline>If God will be avenged for the deed, </verseline>
<verseline>O, know you yet He doth it publicly</verseline>
<verseline>Take not the quarrel from His pow&#8217;rful arm; </verseline>
<verseline>He needs no indirect or lawless course </verseline>
<verseline>To cut off those that have offended Him</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>Who made thee then a bloody minister </verseline>
<verseline>When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet, </verseline>
<verseline>That princely novice, was struck dead by thee? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>My brother&#8217;s love, the devil, and my rage</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>Thy brother&#8217;s love, our duty, and thy faults, </verseline>
<verseline>Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>If you do love my brother, hate not me; </verseline>
<verseline>I am his brother, and I love him well</verseline>
<verseline>If you are hir&#8217;d for meed, go back again, </verseline>
<verseline>And I will send you to my brother Gloucester, </verseline>
<verseline>Who shall reward you better for my life </verseline>
<verseline>Than Edward will for tidings of my death</verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>You are deceiv&#8217;d: your brother Gloucester hates you</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear</verseline>
<verseline>Go you to him from me</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>Ay, so we will</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Tell him when that our princely father York </verseline>
<verseline>Bless&#8217;d his three sons with his victorious arm </verseline>
<verseline>And charg&#8217;d us from his soul to love each other, </verseline>
<verseline>He little thought of this divided friendship</verseline>
<verseline>Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>Ay, millstones; as he lesson&#8217;d us to weep</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>O, do not slander him, for he is kind</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you deceive yourself: </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis he that sends us to destroy you here</verseline>
<character>    Clarence</character>
<verseline>It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune </verseline>
<verseline>And hugg&#8217;d me in his arms, and swore with sobs </verseline>
<verseline>That he would labour my delivery</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>Why, so he doth, when he delivers you </verseline>
<verseline>From this earth&#8217;s thraldom to the joys of heaven</verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<prose>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord</prose>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Have you that holy feeling in your souls </verseline>
<verseline>To counsel me to make my peace with God, </verseline>
<verseline>And are you yet to your own souls so blind </verseline>
<verseline>That you will war with God by murd&#8217;ring me? </verseline>
<verseline>O, sirs, consider: they that set you on </verseline>
<verseline>To do this deed will hate you for the deed</verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<verseline>What shall we do? </verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Relent, and save your souls</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>Relent! No, &#8216;tis cowardly and womanish</verseline>
<character>Clarence </character>
<verseline>Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish</verseline>
<verseline>Which of you, if you were a prince&#8217;s son, </verseline>
<verseline>Being pent from liberty as I am now, </verseline>
<verseline>If two such murderers as yourselves came to you, </verseline>
<verseline>Would not entreat for life? </verseline>
<verseline>My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks; </verseline>
<verseline>O, if thine eye be not a flatterer, </verseline>
<verseline>Come thou on my side and entreat for me&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>As you would beg were you in my distress</verseline>
<verseline>A begging prince what beggar pities not? </verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<verseline>Look behind you, my lord</verseline>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>[Stabbing him] </verseline>
<verseline>Take that, and that. If all this will not do, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll drown you in the malmsey-butt within</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit with the body </stage_directions>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<verseline>A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch&#8217;d! </verseline>
<verseline>How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands </verseline>
<verseline>Of this most grievous murder! </verseline>
<stage_directions> Re-enter First Murderer </stage_directions>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>How now, what mean&#8217;st thou that thou help&#8217;st me not? </verseline>
<verseline>By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have been! </verseline>
<character>Second Murderer </character>
<verseline>I would he knew that I had sav&#8217;d his brother! </verseline>
<verseline>Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say; </verseline>
<verseline>For I repent me that the Duke is slain</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<character>First Murderer </character>
<verseline>So do not I. Go, coward as thou art</verseline>
<verseline>Well, I&#8217;ll go hide the body in some hole, </verseline>
<verseline>Till that the Duke give order for his burial; </verseline>
<verseline>And when I have my meed, I will away; </verseline>
<verseline>For this will out, and then I must not stay</verseline>

<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Why, so. Now have I done a good day&#8217;s work</verseline>
<verseline>You peers, continue this united league</verseline>
<verseline>I every day expect an embassage </verseline>
<verseline>From my Redeemer to redeem me hence; </verseline>
<verseline>And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven, </verseline>
<verseline>Since I have made my friends at peace on earth</verseline>
<verseline>Hastings and Rivers, take each other&#8217;s hand; </verseline>
<verseline>Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>By heaven, my soul is purg&#8217;d from grudging hate; </verseline>
<verseline>And with my hand I seal my true heart&#8217;s love</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>So thrive I, as I truly swear the like! </verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Take heed you dally not before your king; </verseline>
<verseline>Lest He that is the supreme King of kings </verseline>
<verseline>Confound your hidden falsehood and award </verseline>
<verseline>Either of you to be the other&#8217;s end</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>So prosper I, as I swear perfect love! </verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>And I, as I love Hastings with my heart! </verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Madam, yourself is not exempt from this; </verseline>
<verseline>Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you: </verseline>
<verseline>You have been factious one against the other</verseline>
<verseline>Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand; </verseline>
<verseline>And what you do, do it unfeignedly</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>There, Hastings; I will never more remember </verseline>
<verseline>Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine! </verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord Marquis</verseline>
<character>Dorset </character>
<verseline>This interchange of love, I here protest, </verseline>
<verseline>Upon my part shall be inviolable</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>And so swear I [They embrace] </verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league </verseline>
<verseline>With thy embracements to my wife&#8217;s allies, </verseline>
<verseline>And make me happy in your unity</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>[To the Queen]   </verseline>
<verseline>Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate </verseline>
<verseline>Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love </verseline>
<verseline>Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me </verseline>
<verseline>With hate in those where I expect most love! </verseline>
<verseline>When I have most need to employ a friend </verseline>
<verseline>And most assured that he is a friend, </verseline>
<verseline>Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile, </verseline>
<verseline>Be he unto me! This do I beg of God </verseline>
<verseline>When I am cold in love to you or yours</verseline>
<verseline>[They embrace] </verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham, </verseline>
<verseline>Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart</verseline>
<verseline>There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here </verseline>
<verseline>To make the blessed period of this peace</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>And, in good time, </verseline>
<verseline>Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Gloucester, and Ratcliff </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Good morrow to my sovereign King and Queen; </verseline>
<verseline>And, princely peers, a happy time of day! </verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day</verseline>
<verseline>Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity, </verseline>
<verseline>Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate, </verseline>
<verseline>Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord</verseline>
<verseline>Among this princely heap, if any here, </verseline>
<verseline>By false intelligence or wrong surmise, </verseline>
<verseline>Hold me a foe&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>If I unwittingly, or in my rage, </verseline>
<verseline>Have aught committed that is hardly borne </verseline>
<verseline>To any in this presence, I desire </verseline>
<verseline>To reconcile me to his friendly peace: </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis death to me to be at enmity; </verseline>
<verseline>I hate it, and desire all good men&#8217;s love</verseline>
<verseline>First, madam, I entreat true peace of you, </verseline>
<verseline>Which I will purchase with my duteous service; </verseline>
<verseline>Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, </verseline>
<verseline>If ever any grudge were lodg&#8217;d between us; </verseline>
<verseline>Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset, </verseline>
<verseline>That all without desert have frown&#8217;d on me; </verseline>
<verseline>Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you; </verseline>
<verseline>Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all</verseline>
<verseline>I do not know that Englishman alive </verseline>
<verseline>With whom my soul is any jot at odds </verseline>
<verseline>More than the infant that is born to-night</verseline>
<verseline>I thank my God for my humility</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>A holy day shall this be kept hereafter</verseline>
<verseline>I would to God all strifes were well compounded</verseline>
<verseline>My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness </verseline>
<verseline>To take our brother Clarence to your grace</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Why, madam, have I off&#8217;red love for this, </verseline>
<verseline>To be so flouted in this royal presence? </verseline>
<verseline>Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead? </verseline>
<verseline>[They all start] </verseline>
<verseline>You do him injury to scorn his corse</verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Who knows not he is dead! Who knows he is? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>All-seeing heaven, what a world is this! </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest? </verseline>
<character>Dorset </character>
<verseline>Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence </verseline>
<verseline>But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks</verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Is Clarence dead? The order was revers&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>But he, poor man, by your first order died, </verseline>
<verseline>And that a winged Mercury did bear; </verseline>
<verseline>Some tardy cripple bare the countermand </verseline>
<verseline>That came too lag to see him buried</verseline>
<verseline>God grant that some, less noble and less loyal, </verseline>
<verseline>Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood, </verseline>
<verseline>Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did, </verseline>
<verseline>And yet go current from suspicion! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Derby </stage_directions>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>A boon, my sovereign, for my service done! </verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow</verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>I will not rise unless your Highness hear me</verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Then say at once what is it thou requests</verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant&#8217;s life; </verseline>
<verseline>Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman </verseline>
<verseline>Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk</verseline>
<character>King Edward </character>
<verseline>Have I a tongue to doom my brother&#8217;s death, </verseline>
<verseline>And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave? </verseline>
<verseline>My brother killed no man-his fault was thought, </verseline>
<verseline>And yet his punishment was bitter death</verseline>
<verseline>Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath, </verseline>
<verseline>Kneel&#8217;d at my feet, and bid me be advis&#8217;d? </verseline>
<verseline>Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love? </verseline>
<verseline>Who told me how the poor soul did forsake </verseline>
<verseline>The mighty Warwick and did fight for me? </verseline>
<verseline>Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury </verseline>
<verseline>When Oxford had me down, he rescued me </verseline>
<verseline>And said &#8216;Dear Brother, live, and be a king&#8217;? </verseline>
<verseline>Who told me, when we both lay in the field </verseline>
<verseline>Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me </verseline>
<verseline>Even in his garments, and did give himself, </verseline>
<verseline>All thin and naked, to the numb cold night? </verseline>
<verseline>All this from my remembrance brutish wrath </verseline>
<verseline>Sinfully pluck&#8217;d, and not a man of you </verseline>
<verseline>Had so much race to put it in my mind</verseline>
<verseline>But when your carters or your waiting-vassals </verseline>
<verseline>Have done a drunken slaughter and defac&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>The precious image of our dear Redeemer, </verseline>
<verseline>You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon; </verseline>
<verseline>And I, unjustly too, must grant it you</verseline>
<verseline>[Derby rises] </verseline>
<verseline>But for my brother not a man would speak; </verseline>
<verseline>Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself </verseline>
<verseline>For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all </verseline>
<verseline>Have been beholding to him in his life; </verseline>
<verseline>Yet none of you would once beg for his life</verseline>
<verseline>O God, I fear thy justice will take hold </verseline>
<verseline>On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this! </verseline>
<verseline>Come, Hastings, help me to my closet</verseline>
<verseline>Ah, poor Clarence! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt some with King and Queen </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>This is the fruits of rashness. Mark&#8217;d you not </verseline>
<verseline>How that the guilty kindred of the Queen </verseline>
<verseline>Look&#8217;d pale when they did hear of Clarence&#8217; death? </verseline>
<verseline>O, they did urge it still unto the King! </verseline>
<verseline>God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go </verseline>
<verseline>To comfort Edward with our company? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>We wait upon your Grace</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt </stage_directions>
<scene>Scene 2</scene>
<location>London. The palace </location>
<stage_directions>Enter the old Duchess Of York, with the Son and Daughter of Clarence </stage_directions>
<character>Son </character>
<verseline>Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead? </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>No, boy</verseline>
<character>Daughter </character>
<verseline>Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast, </verseline>
<verseline>And cry &#8216;O Clarence, my unhappy son!&#8217;? </verseline>
<character>Son </character>
<verseline>Why do you look on us, and shake your head, </verseline>
<verseline>And call us orphans, wretches, castaways, </verseline>
<verseline>If that our noble father were alive? </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>My pretty cousins, you mistake me both; </verseline>
<verseline>I do lament the sickness of the King, </verseline>
<verseline>As loath to lose him, not your father&#8217;s death; </verseline>
<verseline>It were lost sorrow to wail one that&#8217;s lost</verseline>
<character>Son </character>
<verseline>Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead</verseline>
<verseline>The King mine uncle is to blame for it</verseline>
<verseline>God will revenge it; whom I will importune </verseline>
<verseline>With earnest prayers all to that effect</verseline>
<character>Daughter </character>
<verseline>And so will I</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you well</verseline>
<verseline>Incapable and shallow innocents, </verseline>
<verseline>You cannot guess who caus&#8217;d your father&#8217;s death</verseline>
<character>Son </character>
<verseline>Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester </verseline>
<verseline>Told me the King, provok&#8217;d to it by the Queen, </verseline>
<verseline>Devis&#8217;d impeachments to imprison him</verseline>
<verseline>And when my uncle told me so, he wept, </verseline>
<verseline>And pitied me, and kindly kiss&#8217;d my cheek; </verseline>
<verseline>Bade me rely on him as on my father, </verseline>
<verseline>And he would love me dearly as a child</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape, </verseline>
<verseline>And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice! </verseline>
<verseline>He is my son; ay, and therein my shame; </verseline>
<verseline>Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit</verseline>
<character>Son </character>
<verseline>Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam? </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Ay, boy</verseline>
<character>Son </character>
<verseline>I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this? </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Queen Elizabeth, with her hair about her ears; Rivers and Dorset after her </stage_directions>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and weep, </verseline>
<verseline>To chide my fortune, and torment myself? </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll join with black despair against my soul </verseline>
<verseline>And to myself become an enemy</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>What means this scene of rude impatience? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>To make an act of tragic violence</verseline>
<verseline>Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead</verseline>
<verseline>Why grow the branches when the root is gone? </verseline>
<verseline>Why wither not the leaves that want their sap? </verseline>
<verseline>If you will live, lament; if die, be brief, </verseline>
<verseline>That our swift-winged souls may catch the King&#8217;s, </verseline>
<verseline>Or like obedient subjects follow him </verseline>
<verseline>To his new kingdom of ne&#8217;er-changing night</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow </verseline>
<verseline>As I had title in thy noble husband! </verseline>
<verseline>I have bewept a worthy husband&#8217;s death, </verseline>
<verseline>And liv&#8217;d with looking on his images; </verseline>
<verseline>But now two mirrors of his princely semblance </verseline>
<verseline>Are crack&#8217;d in pieces by malignant death, </verseline>
<verseline>And I for comfort have but one false glass, </verseline>
<verseline>That grieves me when I see my shame in him</verseline>
<verseline>Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother </verseline>
<verseline>And hast the comfort of thy children left; </verseline>
<verseline>But death hath snatch&#8217;d my husband from mine arms </verseline>
<verseline>And pluck&#8217;d two crutches from my feeble hands- </verseline>
<verseline>Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I- </verseline>
<verseline>Thine being but a moiety of my moan- </verseline>
<verseline>To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries? </verseline>
<character>Son </character>
<verseline>Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father&#8217;s death! </verseline>
<verseline>How can we aid you with our kindred tears? </verseline>
<character>Daughter </character>
<verseline>Our fatherless distress was left unmoan&#8217;d; </verseline>
<verseline>Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept! </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Give me no help in lamentation; </verseline>
<verseline>I am not barren to bring forth complaints</verseline>
<verseline>All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes </verseline>
<verseline>That I, being govern&#8217;d by the watery moon, </verseline>
<verseline>May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! </verseline>
<verseline>Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward! </verseline>
<character>Children </character>
<verseline>Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence! </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence! </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>What stay had I but Edward? and he&#8217;s gone</verseline>

<verseline>What stay had we but Clarence? and he&#8217;s gone</verseline>

<verseline>Were never orphans had so dear a loss</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Was never mother had so dear a loss</verseline>
<verseline>Alas, I am the mother of these griefs! </verseline>
<verseline>Their woes are parcell&#8217;d, mine is general</verseline>
<verseline>She for an Edward weeps, and so do I: </verseline>
<verseline>I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she</verseline>
<verseline>These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I: </verseline>
<verseline>I for an Edward weep, so do not they</verseline>
<verseline>Alas, you three on me, threefold distress&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow&#8217;s nurse, </verseline>
<verseline>And I will pamper it with lamentation</verseline>
<character>Dorset </character>
<verseline>Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>That you take with unthankfulness his doing</verseline>
<verseline>In common worldly things &#8216;tis called ungrateful </verseline>
<verseline>With dull unwillingness to repay a debt </verseline>
<verseline>Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent; </verseline>
<verseline>Much more to be thus opposite with heaven, </verseline>
<verseline>For it requires the royal debt it lent you</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, </verseline>
<verseline>Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him; </verseline>
<verseline>Let him be crown&#8217;d; in him your comfort lives</verseline>
<verseline>Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward&#8217;s grave, </verseline>
<verseline>And plant your joys in living Edward&#8217;s throne</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Gloucester, Buckingham, Derby, Hastings, and Ratcliff </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause </verseline>
<verseline>To wail the dimming of our shining star; </verseline>
<verseline>But none can help our harms by wailing them</verseline>
<verseline>Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; </verseline>
<verseline>I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee </verseline>
<verseline>I crave your blessing</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast, </verseline>
<verseline>Love, charity, obedience, and true duty! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Amen! [Aside] And make me die a good old man! </verseline>
<verseline>That is the butt end of a mother&#8217;s blessing; </verseline>
<verseline>I marvel that her Grace did leave it out</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers, </verseline>
<verseline>That bear this heavy mutual load of moan, </verseline>
<verseline>Now cheer each other in each other&#8217;s love</verseline>
<verseline>Though we have spent our harvest of this king, </verseline>
<verseline>We are to reap the harvest of his son</verseline>
<verseline>The broken rancour of your high-swol&#8217;n hearts, </verseline>
<verseline>But lately splinter&#8217;d, knit, and join&#8217;d together, </verseline>
<verseline>Must gently be preserv&#8217;d, cherish&#8217;d, and kept</verseline>
<verseline>Me seemeth good that, with some little train, </verseline>
<verseline>Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet </verseline>
<verseline>Hither to London, to be crown&#8217;d our King</verseline>
<character>Rivers  </character>
<verseline>Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude </verseline>
<verseline>The new-heal&#8217;d wound of malice should break out, </verseline>
<verseline>Which would be so much the more dangerous </verseline>
<verseline>By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern&#8217;d; </verseline>
<verseline>Where every horse bears his commanding rein </verseline>
<verseline>And may direct his course as please himself, </verseline>
<verseline>As well the fear of harm as harm apparent, </verseline>
<verseline>In my opinion, ought to be prevented</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I hope the King made peace with all of us; </verseline>
<verseline>And the compact is firm and true in me</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>And so in me; and so, I think, in an</verseline>
<verseline>Yet, since it is but green, it should be put </verseline>
<verseline>To no apparent likelihood of breach, </verseline>
<verseline>Which haply by much company might be urg&#8217;d; </verseline>
<verseline>Therefore I say with noble Buckingham </verseline>
<verseline>That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>And so say I</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Then be it so; and go we to determine </verseline>
<verseline>Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow</verseline>
<verseline>Madam, and you, my sister, will you go </verseline>
<verseline>To give your censures in this business? </verseline>

<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince, </verseline>
<verseline>For God sake, let not us two stay at home; </verseline>
<verseline>For by the way I&#8217;ll sort occasion, </verseline>
<verseline>As index to the story we late talk&#8217;d of, </verseline>
<verseline>To part the Queen&#8217;s proud kindred from the Prince</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>My other self, my counsel&#8217;s consistory, </verseline>
<verseline>My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin, </verseline>
<verseline>I, as a child, will go by thy direction</verseline>

<character>First Citizen </character>
<prose>Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so fast? </prose>
<character>Second Citizen </character>
<verseline>I promise you, I scarcely know myself</verseline>
<verseline>Hear you the news abroad? </verseline>
<character>First Citizen </character>
<verseline>Yes, that the King is dead</verseline>
<character>Second Citizen </character>
<verseline>Ill news, by&#8217;r lady; seldom comes the better</verseline>
<verseline>I fear, I fear &#8216;twill prove a giddy world</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter another Citizen </stage_directions>
<character>Third Citizen </character>
<verseline>Neighbours, God speed! </verseline>
<character>First Citizen </character>
<verseline>Give you good morrow, sir</verseline>
<character>Third Citizen </character>
<prose>Doth the news hold of good King Edward&#8217;s death? </prose>
<character>Second Citizen </character>
<prose>Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while! </prose>
<character>Third Citizen </character>
<prose>Then, masters, look to see a troublous world</prose>
<character>First Citizen </character>
<prose>No, no; by God&#8217;s good grace, his son shall reign</prose>
<character>Third Citizen </character>
<prose>Woe to that land that&#8217;s govern&#8217;d by a child</prose>
<character>Second Citizen </character>
<verseline>In him there is a hope of government, </verseline>
<verseline>Which, in his nonage, council under him, </verseline>
<verseline>And, in his full and ripened years, himself, </verseline>
<verseline>No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well</verseline>
<character>First Citizen </character>
<verseline>So stood the state when Henry the Sixth </verseline>
<verseline>Was crown&#8217;d in Paris but at nine months old</verseline>
<character>Third Citizen </character>
<verseline>Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot; </verseline>
<verseline>For then this land was famously enrich&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>With politic grave counsel; then the King </verseline>
<verseline>Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace</verseline>
<character>First Citizen </character>
<prose>Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother</prose>
<character>Third Citizen </character>
<verseline>Better it were they all came by his father, </verseline>
<verseline>Or by his father there were none at all; </verseline>
<verseline>For emulation who shall now be nearest </verseline>
<verseline>Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not</verseline>
<verseline>O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester! </verseline>
<verseline>And the Queen&#8217;s sons and brothers haught and proud; </verseline>
<verseline>And were they to be rul&#8217;d, and not to rule, </verseline>
<verseline>This sickly land might solace as before</verseline>
<character>First Citizen </character>
<prose>Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be well</prose>
<character>Third Citizen </character>
<verseline>When clouds are seen, wise men put on their cloaks; </verseline>
<verseline>When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand; </verseline>
<verseline>When the sun sets, who doth not look for night? </verseline>
<verseline>Untimely storms make men expect a dearth</verseline>
<verseline>All may be well; but, if God sort it so, </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis more than we deserve or I expect</verseline>
<character>Second Citizen </character>
<verseline>Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear</verseline>
<verseline>You cannot reason almost with a man </verseline>
<verseline>That looks not heavily and fun of dread</verseline>
<character>Third Citizen </character>
<verseline>Before the days of change, still is it so; </verseline>
<verseline>By a divine instinct men&#8217;s minds mistrust </verseline>
<verseline>Ensuing danger; as by proof we see </verseline>
<verseline>The water swell before a boist&#8217;rous storm</verseline>
<verseline>But leave it all to God. Whither away? </verseline>
<character>Second Citizen </character>
<verseline>Marry, we were sent for to the justices</verseline>

<character>Archbishop </character>
<verseline>Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford, </verseline>
<verseline>And at Northampton they do rest to-night; </verseline>
<verseline>To-morrow or next day they will be here</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>I long with all my heart to see the Prince</verseline>
<verseline>I hope he is much grown since last I saw him</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>But I hear no; they say my son of York </verseline>
<verseline>Has almost overta&#8217;en him in his growth</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Ay, mother; but I would not have it so</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper, </verseline>
<verseline>My uncle Rivers talk&#8217;d how I did grow </verseline>
<verseline>More than my brother. &#8216;Ay,&#8217; quoth my uncle Gloucester </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.&#8217; </verseline>
<verseline>And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast, </verseline>
<verseline>Because sweet flow&#8217;rs are slow and weeds make haste</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold </verseline>
<verseline>In him that did object the same to thee</verseline>
<verseline>He was the wretched&#8217;st thing when he was young, </verseline>
<verseline>So long a-growing and so leisurely </verseline>
<verseline>That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious</verseline>
<character>Archbishop </character>
<verseline>And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb&#8217;red, </verseline>
<verseline>I could have given my uncle&#8217;s Grace a flout </verseline>
<verseline>To touch his growth nearer than he touch&#8217;d mine</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast </verseline>
<verseline>That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth</verseline>
<verseline>Grandam, this would have been a biting jest</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this? </verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Grandam, his nurse</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast born</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>If &#8216;twere not she, I cannot tell who told me</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd</verseline>
<character>Archbishop </character>
<verseline>Good madam, be not angry with the child</verseline>

<verseline>Pitchers have ears</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter a Messenger </stage_directions>

<verseline>Here comes a messenger. What news? </verseline>

<verseline>Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>How doth the Prince? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>Well, madam, and in health</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>What is thy news? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>Lord Rivers and Lord Grey </verseline>
<verseline>Are sent to Pomfret, and with them </verseline>
<verseline>Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Who hath committed them? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham</verseline>
<character>Archbishop </character>
<verseline>For what offence? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>The sum of all I can, I have disclos&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>Why or for what the nobles were committed </verseline>
<verseline>Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Ay me, I see the ruin of my house! </verseline>
<verseline>The tiger now hath seiz&#8217;d the gentle hind; </verseline>
<verseline>Insulting tyranny begins to jet </verseline>
<verseline>Upon the innocent and aweless throne</verseline>
<verseline>Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre! </verseline>
<verseline>I see, as in a map, the end of all</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Accursed and unquiet wrangling days, </verseline>
<verseline>How many of you have mine eyes beheld! </verseline>
<verseline>My husband lost his life to get the crown; </verseline>
<verseline>And often up and down my sons were toss&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>For me to joy and weep their gain and loss; </verseline>
<verseline>And being seated, and domestic broils </verseline>
<verseline>Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors </verseline>
<verseline>Make war upon themselves-brother to brother, </verseline>
<verseline>Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous </verseline>
<verseline>And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen, </verseline>
<verseline>Or let me die, to look on death no more! </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary</verseline>
<verseline>Madam, farewell</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Stay, I will go with you</verseline>

<verseline>My gracious lady, go</verseline>
<verseline>And thither bear your treasure and your goods</verseline>
<verseline>For my part, I&#8217;ll resign unto your Grace </verseline>
<verseline>The seal I keep; and so betide to me </verseline>
<verseline>As well I tender you and all of yours! </verseline>

<location> London. A street </location>
<stage_directions>The trumpets sound. Enter the Prince Of Wales, Gloucester, Buckingham, Catesby, Cardinal, Bourchier, and others </stage_directions>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your chamber</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts&#8217; sovereign</verseline>
<verseline>The weary way hath made you melancholy</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>No, uncle; but our crosses on the way </verseline>
<verseline>Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy</verseline>
<verseline>I want more uncles here to welcome me</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your years </verseline>
<verseline>Hath not yet div&#8217;d into the world&#8217;s deceit; </verseline>
<verseline>Nor more can you distinguish of a man </verseline>
<verseline>Than of his outward show; which, God He knows, </verseline>
<verseline>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart</verseline>
<verseline>Those uncles which you want were dangerous; </verseline>
<verseline>Your Grace attended to their sug&#8217;red words </verseline>
<verseline>But look&#8217;d not on the poison of their hearts</verseline>
<verseline>God keep you from them and from such false friends! </verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>God keep me from false friends! but they were none</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter the Lord Mayor and his train </stage_directions>
<character>Mayor </character>
<verseline>God bless your Grace with health and happy days! </verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all</verseline>
<verseline>I thought my mother and my brother York </verseline>
<verseline>Would long ere this have met us on the way</verseline>
<verseline>Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not </verseline>
<verseline>To tell us whether they will come or no! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Lord Hastings </stage_directions>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>And, in good time, here comes the sweating Lord</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come? </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>On what occasion, God He knows, not I, </verseline>
<verseline>The Queen your mother and your brother York </verseline>
<verseline>Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince </verseline>
<verseline>Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace, </verseline>
<verseline>But by his mother was perforce withheld</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course </verseline>
<verseline>Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace </verseline>
<verseline>Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York </verseline>
<verseline>Unto his princely brother presently? </verseline>
<verseline>If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him </verseline>
<verseline>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce</verseline>
<character>Cardinal </character>
<verseline>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory </verseline>
<verseline>Can from his mother win the Duke of York, </verseline>
<verseline>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate </verseline>
<verseline>To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid </verseline>
<verseline>We should infringe the holy privilege </verseline>
<verseline>Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land </verseline>
<verseline>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord, </verseline>
<verseline>Too ceremonious and traditional</verseline>
<verseline>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, </verseline>
<verseline>You break not sanctuary in seizing him</verseline>
<verseline>The benefit thereof is always granted </verseline>
<verseline>To those whose dealings have deserv&#8217;d the place </verseline>
<verseline>And those who have the wit to claim the place</verseline>
<verseline>This Prince hath neither claim&#8217;d it nor deserv&#8217;d it, </verseline>
<verseline>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it</verseline>
<verseline>Then, taking him from thence that is not there, </verseline>
<verseline>You break no privilege nor charter there</verseline>
<verseline>Oft have I heard of sanctuary men; </verseline>
<verseline>But sanctuary children never till now</verseline>
<character>Cardinal </character>
<verseline>My lord, you shall o&#8217;errule my mind for once</verseline>
<verseline>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me? </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>I go, my lord</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt Cardinal and Hastings </stage_directions>
<verseline>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, </verseline>
<verseline>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Where it seems best unto your royal self</verseline>
<verseline>If I may counsel you, some day or two </verseline>
<verseline>Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower, </verseline>
<verseline>Then where you please and shall be thought most fit </verseline>
<verseline>For your best health and recreation</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>I do not like the Tower, of any place</verseline>
<verseline>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place, </verseline>
<verseline>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>Is it upon record, or else reported </verseline>
<verseline>Successively from age to age, he built it? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Upon record, my gracious lord</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>But say, my lord, it were not regist&#8217;red, </verseline>
<verseline>Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age, </verseline>
<verseline>As &#8216;twere retail&#8217;d to all posterity, </verseline>
<verseline>Even to the general all-ending day</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>[Aside] </verseline>
<verseline>So wise so young, they say, do never live long</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>What say you, uncle? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I say, without characters, fame lives long</verseline>
<verseline>[Aside] Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity, </verseline>
<verseline>I moralize two meanings in one word</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>That Julius Caesar was a famous man; </verseline>
<verseline>With what his valour did enrich his wit, </verseline>
<verseline>His wit set down to make his valour live</verseline>
<verseline>Death makes no conquest of this conqueror; </verseline>
<verseline>For now he lives in fame, though not in life</verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham- </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>What, my gracious lord? </verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>An if I live until I be a man, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll win our ancient right in France again, </verseline>
<verseline>Or die a soldier as I liv&#8217;d a king</verseline>

<verseline>Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>Richard of York, how fares our loving brother? </verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours</verseline>
<verseline>Too late he died that might have kept that title, </verseline>
<verseline>Which by his death hath lost much majesty</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York? </verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord, </verseline>
<verseline>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth</verseline>
<verseline>The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>He hath, my lord</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>And therefore is he idle? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>O, my fair cousin, I must not say so</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Then he is more beholding to you than I</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>He may command me as my sovereign; </verseline>
<verseline>But you have power in me as in a kinsman</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart! </verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>A beggar, brother? </verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Of my kind uncle, that I know will give, </verseline>
<verseline>And being but a toy, which is no grief to give</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>A greater gift than that I&#8217;ll give my cousin</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>A greater gift! O, that&#8217;s the sword to it! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts: </verseline>
<verseline>In weightier things you&#8217;ll say a beggar nay</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>It is too heavy for your Grace to wear</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>What, would you have my weapon, little Lord? </verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>I would, that I might thank you as you call me</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>How? </verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Little</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>My Lord of York will still be cross in talk</verseline>
<verseline>Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me</verseline>
<verseline>Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me; </verseline>
<verseline>Because that I am little, like an ape, </verseline>
<verseline>He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons! </verseline>
<verseline>To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle </verseline>
<verseline>He prettily and aptly taunts himself</verseline>
<verseline>So cunning and so young is wonderful</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>My lord, will&#8217;t please you pass along? </verseline>
<verseline>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham </verseline>
<verseline>Will to your mother, to entreat of her </verseline>
<verseline>To meet you at the Tower and welcome you</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord? </verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>My Lord Protector needs will have it so</verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Why, what should you fear? </verseline>
<character>York </character>
<verseline>Marry, my uncle Clarence&#8217; angry ghost</verseline>
<verseline>My grandam told me he was murder&#8217;d there</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>I fear no uncles dead</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Nor none that live, I hope</verseline>
<character>Prince </character>
<verseline>An if they live, I hope I need not fear</verseline>
<verseline>But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart, </verseline>
<verseline>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower</verseline>
<verseline>A sennet</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt all but Gloucester, Buckingham, and Catesby </stage_directions>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Think you, my lord, this little prating York </verseline>
<verseline>Was not incensed by his subtle mother </verseline>
<verseline>To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>No doubt, no doubt. O, &#8216;tis a perilous boy; </verseline>
<verseline>Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable</verseline>
<verseline>He is all the mother&#8217;s, from the top to toe</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby</verseline>
<verseline>Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend </verseline>
<verseline>As closely to conceal what we impart</verseline>
<verseline>Thou know&#8217;st our reasons urg&#8217;d upon the way</verseline>
<verseline>What think&#8217;st thou? Is it not an easy matter </verseline>
<verseline>To make William Lord Hastings of our mind, </verseline>
<verseline>For the instalment of this noble Duke </verseline>
<verseline>In the seat royal of this famous isle? </verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>He for his father&#8217;s sake so loves the Prince </verseline>
<verseline>That he will not be won to aught against him</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>What think&#8217;st thou then of Stanley? Will not he? </verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>He will do all in all as Hastings doth</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, </verseline>
<verseline>And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings </verseline>
<verseline>How he doth stand affected to our purpose; </verseline>
<verseline>And summon him to-morrow to the Tower, </verseline>
<verseline>To sit about the coronation</verseline>
<verseline>If thou dost find him tractable to us, </verseline>
<verseline>Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons; </verseline>
<verseline>If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling, </verseline>
<verseline>Be thou so too, and so break off the talk, </verseline>
<verseline>And give us notice of his inclination; </verseline>
<verseline>For we to-morrow hold divided councils, </verseline>
<verseline>Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby, </verseline>
<verseline>His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries </verseline>
<verseline>To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle; </verseline>
<verseline>And bid my lord, for joy of this good news, </verseline>
<verseline>Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly</verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>My good lords both, with all the heed I can</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep? </verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>You shall, my lord</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>At Crosby House, there shall you find us both</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Catesby </stage_directions>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive </verseline>
<verseline>Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Chop off his head-something we will determine</verseline>
<verseline>And, look when I am King, claim thou of me </verseline>
<verseline>The earldom of Hereford and all the movables </verseline>
<verseline>Whereof the King my brother was possess&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll claim that promise at your Grace&#8217;s hand</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>And look to have it yielded with all kindness</verseline>
<verseline>Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards </verseline>
<verseline>We may digest our complots in some form</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt </stage_directions>
<scene>Scene 2</scene>
<location>Before Lord Hasting&#8217;S house </location>
<stage_directions>Enter a Messenger to the door of Hastings </stage_directions>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>My lord, my lord! [Knocking] </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>[Within] Who knocks? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>One from the Lord Stanley</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>[Within] What is&#8217;t o&#8217;clock? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>Upon the stroke of four</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Lord Hastings </stage_directions>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>So it appears by that I have to say</verseline>
<verseline>First, he commends him to your noble self</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>What then? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>Then certifies your lordship that this night </verseline>
<verseline>He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm</verseline>
<verseline>Besides, he says there are two councils kept, </verseline>
<verseline>And that may be determin&#8217;d at the one </verseline>
<verseline>Which may make you and him to rue at th&#8217; other</verseline>
<verseline>Therefore he sends to know your lordship&#8217;s pleasure&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>If you will presently take horse with him </verseline>
<verseline>And with all speed post with him toward the north </verseline>
<verseline>To shun the danger that his soul divines</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord; </verseline>
<verseline>Bid him not fear the separated council: </verseline>
<verseline>His honour and myself are at the one, </verseline>
<verseline>And at the other is my good friend Catesby; </verseline>
<verseline>Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us </verseline>
<verseline>Whereof I shall not have intelligence</verseline>
<verseline>Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance; </verseline>
<verseline>And for his dreams, I wonder he&#8217;s so simple </verseline>
<verseline>To trust the mock&#8217;ry of unquiet slumbers</verseline>
<verseline>To fly the boar before the boar pursues </verseline>
<verseline>Were to incense the boar to follow us </verseline>
<verseline>And make pursuit where he did mean no chase</verseline>
<verseline>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me; </verseline>
<verseline>And we will both together to the Tower, </verseline>
<verseline>Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly</verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Enter Catesby </stage_directions>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>Many good morrows to my noble lord! </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring</verseline>
<verseline>What news, what news, in this our tott&#8217;ring state? </verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>It is a reeling world indeed, my lord; </verseline>
<verseline>And I believe will never stand upright </verseline>
<verseline>Till Richard wear the garland of the realm</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the crown? </verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>Ay, my good lord</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders </verseline>
<verseline>Before I&#8217;ll see the crown so foul misplac&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it? </verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward </verseline>
<verseline>Upon his party for the gain thereof; </verseline>
<verseline>And thereupon he sends you this good news, </verseline>
<verseline>That this same very day your enemies, </verseline>
<verseline>The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, </verseline>
<verseline>Because they have been still my adversaries; </verseline>
<verseline>But that I&#8217;ll give my voice on Richard&#8217;s side </verseline>
<verseline>To bar my master&#8217;s heirs in true descent, </verseline>
<verseline>God knows I will not do it to the death</verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>God keep your lordship in that gracious mind! </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence, </verseline>
<verseline>That they which brought me in my master&#8217;s hate, </verseline>
<verseline>I live to look upon their tragedy</verseline>
<verseline>Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll send some packing that yet think not on&#8217;t</verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, </verseline>
<verseline>When men are unprepar&#8217;d and look not for it</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out </verseline>
<verseline>With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so &#8216;twill do </verseline>
<verseline>With some men else that think themselves as safe </verseline>
<verseline>As thou and I, who, as thou knowest, are dear </verseline>
<verseline>To princely Richard and to Buckingham</verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>The Princes both make high account of you&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>[Aside] For they account his head upon the bridge</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>I know they do, and I have well deserv&#8217;d it</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Lord Stanley </stage_directions>
<verseline>Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man? </verseline>
<verseline>Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided? </verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby</verseline>
<verseline>You may jest on, but, by the holy rood, </verseline>
<verseline>I do not like these several councils, I</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours, </verseline>
<verseline>And never in my days, I do protest, </verseline>
<verseline>Was it so precious to me as &#8216;tis now</verseline>
<verseline>Think you, but that I know our state secure, </verseline>
<verseline>I would be so triumphant as I am? </verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London, </verseline>
<verseline>Were jocund and suppos&#8217;d their states were sure, </verseline>
<verseline>And they indeed had no cause to mistrust; </verseline>
<verseline>But yet you see how soon the day o&#8217;ercast</verseline>
<verseline>This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt; </verseline>
<verseline>Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward</verseline>
<verseline>What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my Lord? </verseline>
<verseline>To-day the lords you talk&#8217;d of are beheaded</verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>They, for their truth, might better wear their heads </verseline>
<verseline>Than some that have accus&#8217;d them wear their hats</verseline>
<verseline>But come, my lord, let&#8217;s away</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Hastings, a pursuivant </stage_directions>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Go on before; I&#8217;ll talk with this good fellow</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt Stanley and Catesby </stage_directions>
<verseline>How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee? </verseline>
<character>Pursuivant </character>
<verseline>The better that your lordship please to ask</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>I tell thee, man, &#8216;tis better with me now </verseline>
<verseline>Than when thou met&#8217;st me last where now we meet: </verseline>
<verseline>Then was I going prisoner to the Tower </verseline>
<verseline>By the suggestion of the Queen&#8217;s allies; </verseline>
<verseline>But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself- </verseline>
<verseline>This day those enernies are put to death, </verseline>
<verseline>And I in better state than e&#8217;er I was</verseline>
<character>Pursuivant </character>
<verseline>God hold it, to your honour&#8217;s good content! </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me</verseline>
<verseline>[Throws him his purse] </verseline>
<character>Pursuivant </character>
<verseline>I thank your honour </verseline>

<character>Priest </character>
<verseline>Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart</verseline>
<verseline>I am in your debt for your last exercise; </verseline>
<verseline>Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you</verseline>
<verseline>[He whispers in his ear] </verseline>
<character>Priest </character>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll wait upon your lordship</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Buckingham </stage_directions>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>What, talking with a priest, Lord Chamberlain! </verseline>
<verseline>Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest: </verseline>
<verseline>Your honour hath no shriving work in hand</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Good faith, and when I met this holy man, </verseline>
<verseline>The men you talk of came into my mind</verseline>
<verseline>What, go you toward the Tower? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there; </verseline>
<verseline>I shall return before your lordship thence</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>[Aside] </verseline>
<verseline>And supper too, although thou knowest it not.- </verseline>
<verseline>Come, will you go? </verseline>

<verseline>Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this: </verseline>
<verseline>To-day shalt thou behold a subject die </verseline>
<verseline>For truth, for duty, and for loyalty</verseline>
<character>Grey </character>
<verseline>God bless the Prince from all the pack of you! </verseline>
<verseline>A knot you are of damned blood-suckers</verseline>
<character>Vaughan </character>
<verseline>You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter</verseline>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison, </verseline>
<verseline>Fatal and ominous to noble peers! </verseline>
<verseline>Within the guilty closure of thy walls </verseline>
<verseline>Richard the Second here was hack&#8217;d to death; </verseline>
<verseline>And for more slander to thy dismal seat, </verseline>
<verseline>We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink</verseline>
<character>Grey </character>
<verseline>Now Margaret&#8217;s curse is fall&#8217;n upon our heads, </verseline>

<verseline>For standing by when Richard stabb&#8217;d her son</verseline>
<character>Rivers </character>
<verseline>Then curs&#8217;d she Richard, then curs&#8217;d she Buckingham, </verseline>
<verseline>Then curs&#8217;d she Hastings. O, remember, God, </verseline>
<verseline>To hear her prayer for them, as now for us! </verseline>
<verseline>And for my sister, and her princely sons, </verseline>
<verseline>Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, </verseline>
<verseline>Which, as thou know&#8217;st, unjustly must be spilt</verseline>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>Make haste; the hour of death is expiate</verseline>

<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met </verseline>
<verseline>Is to determine of the coronation</verseline>
<verseline>In God&#8217;s name speak-when is the royal day? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Is all things ready for the royal time? </verseline>

<verseline>Who knows the Lord Protector&#8217;s mind herein? </verseline>
<verseline>Who is most inward with the noble Duke? </verseline>
<character>Bishop Of Ely</character>
<verseline>Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>We know each other&#8217;s faces; for our hearts, </verseline>
<verseline>He knows no more of mine than I of yours; </verseline>

<verseline>Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well; </verseline>
<verseline>But for his purpose in the coronation </verseline>
<verseline>I have not sounded him, nor he deliver&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>His gracious pleasure any way therein</verseline>
<verseline>But you, my honourable lords, may name the time; </verseline>
<verseline>And in the Duke&#8217;s behalf I&#8217;ll give my voice, </verseline>

<verseline>Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester? </verseline>
<verseline>I have sent for these strawberries</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning; </verseline>
<verseline>There&#8217;s some conceit or other likes him well </verseline>
<verseline>When that he bids good morrow with such spirit</verseline>
<verseline>I think there&#8217;s never a man in Christendom </verseline>
<verseline>Can lesser hide his love or hate than he; </verseline>
<verseline>For by his face straight shall you know his heart</verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>What of his heart perceive you in his face </verseline>
<verseline>By any livelihood he show&#8217;d to-day? </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Marry, that with no man here he is offended; </verseline>
<verseline>For, were he, he had shown it in his looks</verseline>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Gloucester and Buckingham </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I pray you all, tell me what they deserve </verseline>
<verseline>That do conspire my death with devilish plots </verseline>
<verseline>Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>Upon my body with their hellish charms? </verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord, </verseline>
<verseline>Makes me most forward in this princely presence </verseline>
<verseline>To doom th&#8217; offenders, whosoe&#8217;er they be</verseline>
<verseline>I say, my lord, they have deserved death</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Then be your eyes the witness of their evil</verseline>
<verseline>Look how I am bewitch&#8217;d; behold, mine arm </verseline>
<verseline>Is like a blasted sapling wither&#8217;d up</verseline>
<verseline>And this is Edward&#8217;s wife, that monstrous witch, </verseline>
<verseline>Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore, </verseline>
<verseline>That by their witchcraft thus have marked me</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>If they have done this deed, my noble lord- </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>If?&#8212;thou protector of this damned strumpet, </verseline>
<verseline>Talk&#8217;st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor</verseline>
<verseline>Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear </verseline>
<verseline>I will not dine until I see the same</verseline>
<verseline>Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done</verseline>
<verseline>The rest that love me, rise and follow me</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt all but Hastings, Lovel, and Ratcliff </stage_directions>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me; </verseline>
<verseline>For I, too fond, might have prevented this</verseline>
<character>Stanley did dream the boar did raze our helms, </character>
<verseline>And I did scorn it and disdain to fly</verseline>
<verseline>Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble, </verseline>
<verseline>And started when he look&#8217;d upon the Tower, </verseline>
<verseline>As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house</verseline>
<verseline>O, now I need the priest that spake to me! </verseline>
<verseline>I now repent I told the pursuivant, </verseline>
<verseline>As too triumphing, how mine enemies </verseline>
<verseline>To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>And I myself secure in grace and favour</verseline>
<verseline>Omargaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse </verseline>
<verseline>Is lighted on poor Hastings&#8217; wretched head! </verseline>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at dinner</verseline>
<verseline>Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>O momentary grace of mortal men, </verseline>
<verseline>Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! </verseline>
<verseline>Who builds his hope in air of your good looks </verseline>
<verseline>Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, </verseline>
<verseline>Ready with every nod to tumble down </verseline>
<verseline>Into the fatal bowels of the deep</verseline>
<character>Lovel </character>
<verseline>Come, come, dispatch; &#8216;tis bootless to exclaim</verseline>
<character>Hastings </character>
<verseline>O bloody Richard! Miserable England! </verseline>
<verseline>I prophesy the fearfull&#8217;st time to thee </verseline>
<verseline>That ever wretched age hath look&#8217;d upon</verseline>
<verseline>Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head</verseline>

<verseline>Murder thy breath in middle of a word, </verseline>
<verseline>And then again begin, and stop again, </verseline>
<verseline>As if thou were distraught and mad with terror? </verseline>

<verseline>Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian; </verseline>
<verseline>Speak and look back, and pry on every side, </verseline>
<verseline>Tremble and start at wagging of a straw, </verseline>
<verseline>Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks </verseline>

<verseline>At any time to grace my stratagems</verseline>
<verseline>But what, is Catesby gone? </verseline>

<verseline>Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Look back, defend thee; here are enemies</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>God and our innocence defend and guard us! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Lovel and Ratcliff, with Hastings&#8217; head </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel</verseline>
<character>Lovel </character>
<verseline>Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, </verseline>
<verseline>The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>So dear I lov&#8217;d the man that I must weep</verseline>
<verseline>I took him for the plainest harmless creature </verseline>
<verseline>That breath&#8217;d upon the earth a Christian; </verseline>
<verseline>Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded </verseline>
<verseline>The history of all her secret thoughts</verseline>
<verseline>So smooth he daub&#8217;d his vice with show of virtue </verseline>
<verseline>That, his apparent open guilt omitted, </verseline>
<verseline>I mean his conversation with Shore&#8217;s wife&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>He liv&#8217;d from all attainder of suspects</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Well, well, he was the covert&#8217;st shelt&#8217;red traitor </verseline>
<verseline>That ever liv&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>Would you imagine, or almost believe&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Were&#8217;t not that by great preservation </verseline>
<verseline>We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor </verseline>
<verseline>This day had plotted, in the council-house, </verseline>
<verseline>To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester</verseline>
<character>Mayor </character>
<verseline>Had he done so? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>What! think you we are Turks or Infidels? </verseline>
<verseline>Or that we would, against the form of law, </verseline>
<verseline>Proceed thus rashly in the villain&#8217;s death </verseline>
<verseline>But that the extreme peril of the case, </verseline>
<verseline>The peace of England and our persons&#8217; safety, </verseline>
<verseline>Enforc&#8217;d us to this execution? </verseline>
<character>Mayor </character>
<verseline>Now, fair befall you! He deserv&#8217;d his death; </verseline>
<verseline>And your good Graces both have well proceeded </verseline>
<verseline>To warn false traitors from the like attempts</verseline>
<verseline>I never look&#8217;d for better at his hands </verseline>
<verseline>After he once fell in with Mistress Shore</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Yet had we not determin&#8217;d he should die </verseline>
<verseline>Until your lordship came to see his end&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Which now the loving haste of these our friends, </verseline>
<verseline>Something against our meanings, have prevented&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Because, my lord, I would have had you heard </verseline>
<verseline>The traitor speak, and timorously confess </verseline>
<verseline>The manner and the purpose of his treasons: </verseline>
<verseline>That you might well have signified the same </verseline>
<verseline>Unto the citizens, who haply may </verseline>
<verseline>Misconster us in him and wail his death</verseline>
<character>Mayor </character>
<verseline>But, my good lord, your Grace&#8217;s words shall serve </verseline>
<verseline>As well as I had seen and heard him speak; </verseline>
<verseline>And do not doubt, right noble Princes both, </verseline>
<verseline>But I&#8217;ll acquaint our duteous citizens </verseline>
<verseline>With all your just proceedings in this cause</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>And to that end we wish&#8217;d your lordship here, </verseline>
<verseline>T&#8217; avoid the the the censures of the carping world</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Which since you come too late of our intent, </verseline>
<verseline>Yet witness what you hear we did intend</verseline>
<verseline>And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Lord Mayor </stage_directions>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham</verseline>
<verseline>The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post</verseline>
<verseline>There, at your meet&#8217;st advantage of the time, </verseline>
<verseline>Infer the bastardy of Edward&#8217;s children</verseline>
<verseline>Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen </verseline>
<verseline>Only for saying he would make his son </verseline>
<verseline>Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house, </verseline>
<verseline>Which by the sign thereof was termed so</verseline>
<verseline>Moreover, urge his hateful luxury </verseline>
<verseline>And bestial appetite in change of lust, </verseline>
<verseline>Which stretch&#8217;d unto their servants, daughters, wives, </verseline>
<verseline>Even where his raging eye or savage heart </verseline>
<verseline>Without control lusted to make a prey</verseline>
<verseline>Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: </verseline>
<verseline>Tell them, when that my mother went with child </verseline>
<verseline>Of that insatiate Edward, noble York </verseline>
<verseline>My princely father then had wars in France </verseline>
<verseline>And, by true computation of the time, </verseline>
<verseline>Found that the issue was not his begot; </verseline>
<verseline>Which well appeared in his lineaments, </verseline>
<verseline>Being nothing like the noble Duke my father</verseline>
<verseline>Yet touch this sparingly, as &#8216;twere far off; </verseline>
<verseline>Because, my lord, you know my mother lives</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Doubt not, my lord, I&#8217;ll play the orator </verseline>
<verseline>As if the golden fee for which I plead </verseline>
<verseline>Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard&#8217;s Castle; </verseline>
<verseline>Where you shall find me well accompanied </verseline>
<verseline>With reverend fathers and well learned bishops</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>I go; and towards three or four o&#8217;clock </verseline>

<verseline>Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw</verseline>
<verseline>[To Catesby] Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both </verseline>
<verseline>Meet me within this hour at Baynard&#8217;s Castle</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt all but Gloucester </stage_directions>
<verseline>Now will I go to take some privy order </verseline>
<verseline>To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, </verseline>

<character>Scrivener </character>
<verseline>Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings; </verseline>
<verseline>Which in a set hand fairly is engross&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>That it may be to-day read o&#8217;er in Paul&#8217;s</verseline>
<verseline>And mark how well the sequel hangs together: </verseline>
<verseline>Eleven hours I have spent to write it over, </verseline>
<verseline>For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me; </verseline>
<verseline>The precedent was full as long a-doing; </verseline>
<verseline>And yet within these five hours Hastings liv&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>Untainted, unexamin&#8217;d, free, at liberty</verseline>
<verseline>Here&#8217;s a good world the while! Who is so gros </verseline>
<verseline>That cannot see this palpable device? </verseline>
<verseline>Yet who&#8217;s so bold but says he sees it not? </verseline>
<verseline>Bad is the world; and all will come to nought, </verseline>

<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>How now, how now! What say the citizens? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord, </verseline>
<verseline>The citizens are mum, say not a word</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Touch&#8217;d you the bastardy of Edward&#8217;s children? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy, </verseline>
<verseline>And his contract by deputy in France; </verseline>
<verseline>Th&#8217; insatiate greediness of his desire, </verseline>
<verseline>And his enforcement of the city wives; </verseline>
<verseline>His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy, </verseline>
<verseline>As being got, your father then in France, </verseline>
<verseline>And his resemblance, being not like the Duke</verseline>
<verseline>Withal I did infer your lineaments, </verseline>
<verseline>Being the right idea of your father, </verseline>
<verseline>Both in your form and nobleness of mind; </verseline>
<verseline>Laid open all your victories in Scotland, </verseline>
<verseline>Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace, </verseline>
<verseline>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility; </verseline>
<verseline>Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose </verseline>
<verseline>Untouch&#8217;d or slightly handled in discourse</verseline>
<verseline>And when mine oratory drew toward end </verseline>
<verseline>I bid them that did love their country&#8217;s good </verseline>
<verseline>Cry &#8216;God save Richard, England&#8217;s royal King!&#8217; </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>And did they so? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>No, so God help me, they spake not a word; </verseline>
<verseline>But, like dumb statues or breathing stones, </verseline>
<verseline>Star&#8217;d each on other, and look&#8217;d deadly pale</verseline>
<verseline>Which when I saw, I reprehended them, </verseline>
<verseline>And ask&#8217;d the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence</verseline>
<verseline>His answer was, the people were not used </verseline>
<verseline>To be spoke to but by the Recorder</verseline>
<verseline>Then he was urg&#8217;d to tell my tale again</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr&#8217;d&#8217;&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>But nothing spoke in warrant from himself</verseline>
<verseline>When he had done, some followers of mine own </verseline>
<verseline>At lower end of the hall hurl&#8217;d up their caps, </verseline>
<verseline>And some ten voices cried &#8216;God save King Richard!&#8217; </verseline>
<verseline>And thus I took the vantage of those few- </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,&#8217; quoth I </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;This general applause and cheerful shout </verseline>
<verseline>Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.&#8217; </verseline>
<verseline>And even here brake off and came away</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>What, tongueless blocks were they? Would they not speak? </verseline>
<verseline>Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear; </verseline>
<verseline>Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit; </verseline>
<verseline>And look you get a prayer-book in your hand, </verseline>
<verseline>And stand between two churchmen, good my lord; </verseline>
<verseline>For on that ground I&#8217;ll make a holy descant; </verseline>
<verseline>And be not easily won to our requests</verseline>
<verseline>Play the maid&#8217;s part: still answer nay, and take it</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I go; and if you plead as well for them </verseline>

<verseline>To draw him from his holy exercise</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke; </verseline>
<verseline>Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen, </verseline>
<verseline>In deep designs, in matter of great moment, </verseline>
<verseline>No less importing than our general good, </verseline>

<verseline>Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward! </verseline>
<verseline>He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed, </verseline>
<verseline>But on his knees at meditation; </verseline>
<verseline>Not dallying with a brace of courtezans, </verseline>
<verseline>But meditating with two deep divines; </verseline>
<verseline>Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, </verseline>
<verseline>But praying, to enrich his watchful soul</verseline>
<verseline>Happy were England would this virtuous prince </verseline>
<verseline>Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof; </verseline>
<verseline>But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it</verseline>
<character>Mayor </character>
<verseline>Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay! </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again</verseline>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Catesby </stage_directions>
<verseline>Now, Catesby, what says his Grace? </verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>My lord, </verseline>
<verseline>He wonders to what end you have assembled </verseline>
<verseline>Such troops of citizens to come to him</verseline>
<verseline>His Grace not being warn&#8217;d thereof before, </verseline>
<verseline>He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Sorry I am my noble cousin should </verseline>
<verseline>Suspect me that I mean no good to him</verseline>
<verseline>By heaven, we come to him in perfect love; </verseline>
<verseline>And so once more return and tell his Grace</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Catesby </stage_directions>
<verseline>When holy and devout religious men </verseline>

<verseline>See where his Grace stands &#8216;tween two clergymen! </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Two props of virtue for a Christian prince, </verseline>
<verseline>To stay him from the fall of vanity; </verseline>
<verseline>And, see, a book of prayer in his hand, </verseline>
<verseline>True ornaments to know a holy man</verseline>
<verseline>Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince, </verseline>
<verseline>Lend favourable ear to our requests, </verseline>
<verseline>And pardon us the interruption </verseline>
<verseline>Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>My lord, there needs no such apology: </verseline>
<verseline>I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, </verseline>
<verseline>Who, earnest in the service of my God, </verseline>
<verseline>Deferr&#8217;d the visitation of my friends</verseline>
<verseline>But, leaving this, what is your Grace&#8217;s pleasure? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above, </verseline>
<verseline>And all good men of this ungovern&#8217;d isle</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I do suspect I have done some offence </verseline>
<verseline>That seems disgracious in the city&#8217;s eye, </verseline>
<verseline>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>You have, my lord. Would it might please your Grace, </verseline>
<verseline>On our entreaties, to amend your fault! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Know then, it is your fault that you resign </verseline>
<verseline>The supreme seat, the throne majestical, </verseline>
<verseline>The scept&#8217;red office of your ancestors, </verseline>
<verseline>Your state of fortune and your due of birth, </verseline>
<verseline>The lineal glory of your royal house, </verseline>
<verseline>To the corruption of a blemish&#8217;d stock; </verseline>
<verseline>Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, </verseline>
<verseline>Which here we waken to our country&#8217;s good, </verseline>
<verseline>The noble isle doth want her proper limbs; </verseline>
<verseline>Her face defac&#8217;d with scars of infamy, </verseline>
<verseline>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, </verseline>
<verseline>And almost should&#8217;red in the swallowing gulf </verseline>
<verseline>Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion</verseline>
<verseline>Which to recure, we heartily solicit </verseline>
<verseline>Your gracious self to take on you the charge </verseline>
<verseline>And kingly government of this your land- </verseline>
<verseline>Not as protector, steward, substitute, </verseline>
<verseline>Or lowly factor for another&#8217;s gain; </verseline>
<verseline>But as successively, from blood to blood, </verseline>
<verseline>Your right of birth, your empery, your own</verseline>
<verseline>For this, consorted with the citizens, </verseline>
<verseline>Your very worshipful and loving friends, </verseline>
<verseline>And by their vehement instigation, </verseline>
<verseline>In this just cause come I to move your Grace</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>I cannot tell if to depart in silence </verseline>
<verseline>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof </verseline>
<verseline>Best fitteth my degree or your condition</verseline>
<verseline>If not to answer, you might haply think </verseline>
<verseline>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded </verseline>
<verseline>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, </verseline>
<verseline>Which fondly you would here impose on me; </verseline>
<verseline>If to reprove you for this suit of yours, </verseline>
<verseline>So season&#8217;d with your faithful love to me, </verseline>
<verseline>Then, on the other side, I check&#8217;d my friends</verseline>
<verseline>Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first, </verseline>
<verseline>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Definitively thus I answer you: </verseline>
<verseline>Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert </verseline>
<verseline>Unmeritable shuns your high request</verseline>
<verseline>First, if all obstacles were cut away, </verseline>
<verseline>And that my path were even to the crown, </verseline>
<verseline>As the ripe revenue and due of birth, </verseline>
<verseline>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, </verseline>
<verseline>So mighty and so many my defects, </verseline>
<verseline>That I would rather hide me from my greatness&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Than in my greatness covet to be hid, </verseline>
<verseline>And in the vapour of my glory smother&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>But, God be thank&#8217;d, there is no need of me&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>And much I need to help you, were there need</verseline>
<verseline>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit </verseline>
<verseline>Which, mellow&#8217;d by the stealing hours of time, </verseline>
<verseline>Will well become the seat of majesty </verseline>
<verseline>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign</verseline>
<verseline>On him I lay that you would lay on me&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>The right and fortune of his happy stars, </verseline>
<verseline>Which God defend that I should wring from him</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace; </verseline>
<verseline>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, </verseline>
<verseline>All circumstances well considered</verseline>
<verseline>You say that Edward is your brother&#8217;s son</verseline>
<verseline>So say we too, but not by Edward&#8217;s wife; </verseline>
<verseline>For first was he contract to Lady Lucy&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Your mother lives a witness to his vow&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>And afterward by substitute betroth&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>To Bona, sister to the King of France</verseline>
<verseline>These both put off, a poor petitioner, </verseline>
<verseline>A care-craz&#8217;d mother to a many sons, </verseline>
<verseline>A beauty-waning and distressed widow, </verseline>
<verseline>Even in the afternoon of her best days, </verseline>
<verseline>Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye, </verseline>
<verseline>Seduc&#8217;d the pitch and height of his degree </verseline>
<verseline>To base declension and loath&#8217;d bigamy</verseline>
<verseline>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got </verseline>
<verseline>This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince</verseline>
<verseline>More bitterly could I expostulate, </verseline>
<verseline>Save that, for reverence to some alive, </verseline>
<verseline>I give a sparing limit to my tongue</verseline>
<verseline>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self </verseline>
<verseline>This proffer&#8217;d benefit of dignity; </verseline>
<verseline>If not to bless us and the land withal, </verseline>
<verseline>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry </verseline>
<verseline>From the corruption of abusing times </verseline>
<verseline>Unto a lineal true-derived course</verseline>
<character>Mayor </character>
<verseline>Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer&#8217;d love</verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit! </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Alas, why would you heap this care on me? </verseline>
<verseline>I am unfit for state and majesty</verseline>
<verseline>I do beseech you, take it not amiss: </verseline>
<verseline>I cannot nor I will not yield to you</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal, </verseline>
<verseline>Loath to depose the child, your brother&#8217;s son; </verseline>
<verseline>As well we know your tenderness of heart </verseline>
<verseline>And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse, </verseline>
<verseline>Which we have noted in you to your kindred </verseline>
<verseline>And egally indeed to all estates&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Yet know, whe&#8217;er you accept our suit or no, </verseline>
<verseline>Your brother&#8217;s son shall never reign our king; </verseline>
<verseline>But we will plant some other in the throne </verseline>
<verseline>To the disgrace and downfall of your house; </verseline>
<verseline>And in this resolution here we leave you</verseline>
<verseline>Come, citizens. Zounds, I&#8217;ll entreat no more</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt Buckingham, Mayor, and citizens </stage_directions>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit</verseline>
<verseline>If you deny them, all the land will rue it</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Will you enforce me to a world of cares? </verseline>
<verseline>Call them again. I am not made of stones, </verseline>
<verseline>But penetrable to your kind entreaties, </verseline>
<verseline>Albeit against my conscience and my soul</verseline>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Buckingham and the rest </stage_directions>
<verseline>Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men, </verseline>
<verseline>Since you will buckle fortune on my back, </verseline>
<verseline>To bear her burden, whe&#8217;er I will or no, </verseline>
<verseline>I must have patience to endure the load; </verseline>
<verseline>But if black scandal or foul-fac&#8217;d reproach </verseline>
<verseline>Attend the sequel of your imposition, </verseline>
<verseline>Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me </verseline>
<verseline>From all the impure blots and stains thereof; </verseline>
<verseline>For God doth know, and you may partly see, </verseline>
<verseline>How far I am from the desire of this</verseline>
<character>Mayor </character>
<verseline>God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>In saying so, you shall but say the truth</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Then I salute you with this royal title&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Long live King Richard, England&#8217;s worthy King! </verseline>
<character>All </character>
<verseline>Amen</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>To-morrow may it please you to be crown&#8217;d? </verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>Even when you please, for you will have it so</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace; </verseline>
<verseline>And so, most joyfully, we take our leave</verseline>
<character>Gloucester </character>
<verseline>[To the Bishops] </verseline>
<verseline>Come, let us to our holy work again</verseline>
<verseline>Farewell, my cousin; farewell, gentle friends</verseline>

<stage_directions>Enter Queen Elizabeth, Duchess of York, and Marquis of Dorset, at one door; Anne, Duchess of Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet, Clarence&#8217;s young daughter, at another door </stage_directions>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet, </verseline>
<verseline>Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester? </verseline>
<verseline>Now, for my life, she&#8217;s wand&#8217;ring to the Tower, </verseline>
<verseline>On pure heart&#8217;s love, to greet the tender Princes</verseline>
<verseline>Daughter, well met</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>God give your Graces both </verseline>
<verseline>A happy and a joyful time of day! </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>As much to you, good sister! Whither away? </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess, </verseline>
<verseline>Upon the like devotion as yourselves, </verseline>
<verseline>To gratulate the gentle Princes there</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Kind sister, thanks; we&#8217;ll enter all together</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Brakenbury </stage_directions>
<verseline>And in good time, here the lieutenant comes</verseline>
<verseline>Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave, </verseline>
<verseline>How doth the Prince, and my young son of York? </verseline>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>Right well, dear madam. By your patience, </verseline>
<verseline>I may not suffer you to visit them</verseline>
<verseline>The King hath strictly charg&#8217;d the contrary</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>The King! Who&#8217;s that? </verseline>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>I mean the Lord Protector</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>The Lord protect him from that kingly title! </verseline>
<verseline>Hath he set bounds between their love and me? </verseline>
<verseline>I am their mother; who shall bar me from them? </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>I am their father&#8217;s mother; I will see them</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother</verseline>
<verseline>Then bring me to their sights; I&#8217;ll bear thy blame, </verseline>
<verseline>And take thy office from thee on my peril</verseline>
<character>Brakenbury </character>
<verseline>No, madam, no. I may not leave it so; </verseline>
<verseline>I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Enter Stanley </stage_directions>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence, </verseline>
<verseline>And I&#8217;ll salute your Grace of York as mother </verseline>
<verseline>And reverend looker-on of two fair queens</verseline>
<verseline>[To Anne] Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster, </verseline>
<verseline>There to be crowned Richard&#8217;s royal queen</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Ah, cut my lace asunder </verseline>
<verseline>That my pent heart may have some scope to beat, </verseline>
<verseline>Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news! </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news! </verseline>
<character>Dorset </character>
<verseline>Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Odorset, speak not to me, get thee gone! </verseline>
<verseline>Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels; </verseline>
<verseline>Thy mother&#8217;s name is ominous to children</verseline>
<verseline>If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas, </verseline>
<verseline>And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell</verseline>
<verseline>Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house, </verseline>
<verseline>Lest thou increase the number of the dead, </verseline>
<verseline>And make me die the thrall of Margaret&#8217;s curse, </verseline>
<verseline>Nor mother, wife, nor England&#8217;s counted queen</verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam</verseline>
<verseline>Take all the swift advantage of the hours; </verseline>
<verseline>You shall have letters from me to my son </verseline>
<verseline>In your behalf, to meet you on the way</verseline>
<verseline>Be not ta&#8217;en tardy by unwise delay</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>O ill-dispersing wind of misery! </verseline>
<verseline>O my accursed womb, the bed of death! </verseline>
<verseline>A cockatrice hast thou hatch&#8217;d to the world, </verseline>
<verseline>Whose unavoided eye is murderous</verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>And I with all unwillingness will go</verseline>
<verseline>O, would to God that the inclusive verge </verseline>
<verseline>Of golden metal that must round my brow </verseline>
<verseline>Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains! </verseline>
<verseline>Anointed let me be with deadly venom, </verseline>
<verseline>And die ere men can say &#8216;God save the Queen!&#8217; </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory</verseline>
<verseline>To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>No, why? When he that is my husband now </verseline>
<verseline>Came to me, as I follow&#8217;d Henry&#8217;s corse; </verseline>
<verseline>When scarce the blood was well wash&#8217;d from his hands </verseline>
<verseline>Which issued from my other angel husband, </verseline>
<verseline>And that dear saint which then I weeping follow&#8217;d&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>O, when, I say, I look&#8217;d on Richard&#8217;s face, </verseline>
<verseline>This was my wish: &#8216;Be thou&#8217; quoth I &#8216;accurs&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>For making me, so young, so old a widow; </verseline>
<verseline>And when thou wed&#8217;st, let sorrow haunt thy bed; </verseline>
<verseline>And be thy wife, if any be so mad, </verseline>
<verseline>More miserable by the life of thee </verseline>
<verseline>Than thou hast made me by my dear lord&#8217;s death.&#8217; </verseline>
<verseline>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again, </verseline>
<verseline>Within so small a time, my woman&#8217;s heart </verseline>
<verseline>Grossly grew captive to his honey words </verseline>
<verseline>And prov&#8217;d the subject of mine own soul&#8217;s curse, </verseline>
<verseline>Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest; </verseline>
<verseline>For never yet one hour in his bed </verseline>
<verseline>Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep, </verseline>
<verseline>But with his timorous dreams was still awak&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick; </verseline>
<verseline>And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining</verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>No more than with my soul I mourn for yours</verseline>
<character>Dorset </character>
<verseline>Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory! </verseline>
<character>Anne </character>
<verseline>Adieu, poor soul, that tak&#8217;st thy leave of it! </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>[To Dorset] </verseline>
<verseline>Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee! </verseline>
<verseline>[To Anne] </verseline>
<verseline>Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee!   </verseline>
<verseline>[To Queen Elizabeth] </verseline>
<verseline>Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee! </verseline>
<verseline>I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me! </verseline>
<verseline>Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen, </verseline>
<verseline>And each hour&#8217;s joy wreck&#8217;d with a week of teen</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower</verseline>
<verseline>Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes </verseline>
<verseline>Whom envy hath immur&#8217;d within your walls, </verseline>
<verseline>Rough cradle for such little pretty ones</verseline>
<verseline>Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow </verseline>
<verseline>For tender princes, use my babies well</verseline>
<verseline>So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell</verseline>

<scene>Scene 2</scene>
<location>London. The palace </location>
<stage_directions>Sound a sennet. Enter Richard, in pomp, as King; Buckingham, Catesby, Ratcliff, Lovel, a Page, and others </stage_directions>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham! </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>My gracious sovereign? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Give me thy hand</verseline>
<verseline>[Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound] </verseline>
<verseline>Thus high, by thy advice </verseline>
<verseline>And thy assistance, is King Richard seated</verseline>
<verseline>But shall we wear these glories for a day; </verseline>
<verseline>Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Still live they, and for ever let them last! </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch, </verseline>
<verseline>To try if thou be current gold indeed</verseline>
<verseline>Young Edward lives-think now what I would speak</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Say on, my loving lord</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Ha! am I King? &#8216;Tis so; but Edward lives</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>True, noble Prince</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>O bitter consequence: </verseline>
<verseline>That Edward still should live-true noble Prince! </verseline>
<verseline>Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull</verseline>
<verseline>Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead</verseline>
<verseline>And I would have it suddenly perform&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>What say&#8217;st thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Your Grace may do your pleasure</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes</verseline>
<verseline>Say, have I thy consent that they shall die? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Give me some little breath, some pause, dear Lord, </verseline>
<verseline>Before I positively speak in this</verseline>
<verseline>I will resolve you herein presently</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>[Aside to another] </verseline>
<verseline>The King is angry; see, he gnaws his lip</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>I will converse with iron-witted fools </verseline>
<verseline>[Descends from the throne] </verseline>
<verseline>And unrespective boys; none are for me </verseline>
<verseline>That look into me with considerate eyes</verseline>

<verseline>Boy! </verseline>

<verseline>My lord? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Know&#8217;st thou not any whom corrupting gold </verseline>
<verseline>Will tempt unto a close exploit of death? </verseline>
<character>Page </character>
<verseline>I know a discontented gentleman </verseline>
<verseline>Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit</verseline>
<verseline>Gold were as good as twenty orators, </verseline>
<verseline>And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>What is his name? </verseline>
<character>Page </character>
<verseline>His name, my lord, is Tyrrel</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>I partly know the man. Go, call him hither, boy </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Page </stage_directions>
<verseline>The deep-revolving witty Buckingham </verseline>
<verseline>No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels</verseline>

<stage_directions>Enter Stanley </stage_directions>
<verseline>How now, Lord Stanley! What&#8217;s the news? </verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>Know, my loving lord, </verseline>
<verseline>The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled </verseline>
<verseline>To Richmond, in the parts where he abides</verseline>
<verseline>[Stands apart] </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad </verseline>
<verseline>That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick; </verseline>
<verseline>I will take order for her keeping close</verseline>
<verseline>Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman, </verseline>
<verseline>Whom I will marry straight to Clarence&#8217; daughter&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>The boy is foolish, and I fear not him</verseline>
<verseline>Look how thou dream&#8217;st! I say again, give out </verseline>
<verseline>That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die</verseline>
<verseline>About it; for it stands me much upon </verseline>
<verseline>To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit Catesby </stage_directions>
<verseline>I must be married to my brother&#8217;s daughter, </verseline>
<verseline>Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass</verseline>
<verseline>Murder her brothers, and then marry her! </verseline>
<verseline>Uncertain way of gain! But I am in </verseline>
<verseline>So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin</verseline>
<verseline>Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye</verseline>
<stage_directions>Re-enter Page, with Tyrrel </stage_directions>
<verseline>Is thy name Tyrrel? </verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject</verseline>

<verseline>Art thou, indeed? </verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>Prove me, my gracious lord</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Dar&#8217;st&#8217;thou resolve to kill a friend of mine? </verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>Please you; </verseline>
<verseline>But I had rather kill two enemies</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Why, then thou hast it. Two deep enemies, </verseline>
<verseline>Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep&#8217;s disturbers, </verseline>
<verseline>Are they that I would have thee deal upon</verseline>
<verseline>Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower</verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>Let me have open means to come to them, </verseline>
<verseline>And soon I&#8217;ll rid you from the fear of them</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Thou sing&#8217;st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel</verseline>
<verseline>Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear</verseline>
<verseline>[Whispers] </verseline>
<verseline>There is no more but so: say it is done, </verseline>
<verseline>And I will love thee and prefer thee for it</verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>

<character>Buckingham</character>
<verseline>My lord, I have consider&#8217;d in my mind </verseline>
<verseline>The late request that you did sound me in</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>I hear the news, my lord</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Stanley, he is your wife&#8217;s son: well, look unto it</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise, </verseline>
<verseline>For which your honour and your faith is pawn&#8217;d: </verseline>
<verseline>Th&#8217; earldom of Hereford and the movables </verseline>
<verseline>Which you have promised I shall possess</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey </verseline>
<verseline>Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>What says your Highness to my just request? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>I do remember me: Henry the Sixth </verseline>
<verseline>Did prophesy that Richmond should be King, </verseline>
<verseline>When Richmond was a little peevish boy</verseline>
<verseline>A king!-perhaps&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>My lord&#8212; </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>How chance the prophet could not at that time </verseline>
<verseline>Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>My lord, your promise for the earldom&#8212; </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Richmond! When last I was at Exeter, </verseline>
<verseline>The mayor in courtesy show&#8217;d me the castle </verseline>
<verseline>And call&#8217;d it Rugemount, at which name I started, </verseline>
<verseline>Because a bard of Ireland told me once </verseline>
<verseline>I should not live long after I saw Richmond</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>My lord&#8212; </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Ay, what&#8217;s o&#8217;clock? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind </verseline>
<verseline>Of what you promis&#8217;d me</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Well, but o&#8217;clock? </verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Upon the stroke of ten</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Well, let it strike</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Why let it strike? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Because that like a Jack thou keep&#8217;st the stroke </verseline>
<verseline>Betwixt thy begging and my meditation</verseline>
<verseline>I am not in the giving vein to-day</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>May it please you to resolve me in my suit</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt all but Buckingham </stage_directions>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>And is it thus? Repays he my deep service </verseline>
<verseline>With such contempt? Made I him King for this? </verseline>
<verseline>O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone </verseline>
<verseline>To Brecknock while my fearful head is on! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<scene>Scene 3</scene>
<stage_directions>London. The palace </stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Enter Tyrrel </stage_directions>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>The tyrannous and bloody act is done, </verseline>
<verseline>The most arch deed of piteous massacre </verseline>
<verseline>That ever yet this land was guilty of</verseline>
<verseline>Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn </verseline>
<verseline>To do this piece of ruthless butchery, </verseline>
<verseline>Albeit they were flesh&#8217;d villains, bloody dogs, </verseline>
<verseline>Melted with tenderness and mild compassion, </verseline>
<verseline>Wept like two children in their deaths&#8217; sad story</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;O, thus&#8217; quoth Dighton &#8216;lay the gentle babes&#8217;- </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Thus, thus,&#8217; quoth Forrest &#8216;girdling one another </verseline>
<verseline>Within their alabaster innocent arms</verseline>
<verseline>Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, </verseline>
<verseline>And in their summer beauty kiss&#8217;d each other</verseline>
<verseline>A book of prayers on their pillow lay; </verseline>
<verseline>Which once,&#8217; quoth Forrest &#8216;almost chang&#8217;d my mind; </verseline>
<verseline>But, O, the devil&#8217;-there the villain stopp&#8217;d; </verseline>
<verseline>When Dighton thus told on: &#8216;We smothered </verseline>
<verseline>The most replenished sweet work of nature </verseline>
<verseline>That from the prime creation e&#8217;er she framed.&#8217; </verseline>
<verseline>Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse </verseline>
<verseline>They could not speak; and so I left them both, </verseline>
<verseline>To bear this tidings to the bloody King</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter King Richard </stage_directions>
<verseline>And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord! </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news? </verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>If to have done the thing you gave in charge </verseline>
<verseline>Beget your happiness, be happy then, </verseline>
<verseline>For it is done</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>But didst thou see them dead? </verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>I did, my lord</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>And buried, gentle Tyrrel? </verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them; </verseline>
<verseline>But where, to say the truth, I do not know</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper, </verseline>
<verseline>When thou shalt tell the process of their death</verseline>
<verseline>Meantime, but think how I may do thee good </verseline>
<verseline>And be inheritor of thy desire</verseline>
<verseline>Farewell till then</verseline>
<character>Tyrrel </character>
<verseline>I humbly take my leave</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>The son of Clarence have I pent up close; </verseline>
<verseline>His daughter meanly have I match&#8217;d in marriage; </verseline>
<verseline>The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham&#8217;s bosom, </verseline>
<verseline>And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night</verseline>
<verseline>Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims </verseline>
<verseline>At young Elizabeth, my brother&#8217;s daughter, </verseline>
<verseline>And by that knot looks proudly on the crown, </verseline>
<verseline>To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Ratcliff </stage_directions>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>My lord! </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Good or bad news, that thou com&#8217;st in so bluntly? </verseline>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond; </verseline>
<verseline>And Buckingham, back&#8217;d with the hardy Welshmen, </verseline>
<verseline>Is in the field, and still his power increaseth</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Ely with Richmond troubles me more near </verseline>
<verseline>Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength</verseline>
<verseline>Come, I have learn&#8217;d that fearful commenting </verseline>
<verseline>Is leaden servitor to dull delay; </verseline>
<verseline>Delay leads impotent and snail-pac&#8217;d beggary</verseline>
<verseline>Then fiery expedition be my wing, </verseline>
<verseline>Jove&#8217;s Mercury, and herald for a king! </verseline>
<verseline>Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield</verseline>
<verseline>We must be brief when traitors brave the field</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt </stage_directions>
<scene>Scene 4</scene>
<location>London. Before the palace </location>
<stage_directions>Enter old Queen Margaret </stage_directions>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>So now prosperity begins to mellow </verseline>
<verseline>And drop into the rotten mouth of death</verseline>
<verseline>Here in these confines slily have I lurk&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>To watch the waning of mine enemies</verseline>
<verseline>A dire induction am I witness to, </verseline>
<verseline>And will to France, hoping the consequence </verseline>
<verseline>Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical</verseline>
<verseline>Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here? </verseline>
<verseline>[Retires] </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Queen Elizabeth and the Duchess Of York </stage_directions>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Ah, my poor princes! ah, my tender babes! </verseline>
<verseline>My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets! </verseline>
<verseline>If yet your gentle souls fly in the air </verseline>
<verseline>And be not fix&#8217;d in doom perpetual, </verseline>
<verseline>Hover about me with your airy wings </verseline>
<verseline>And hear your mother&#8217;s lamentation</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Hover about her; say that right for right </verseline>
<verseline>Hath dimm&#8217;d your infant morn to aged night</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>So many miseries have craz&#8217;d my voice </verseline>
<verseline>That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute</verseline>
<verseline>Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead? </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet, </verseline>
<verseline>Edward for Edward pays a dying debt</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs </verseline>
<verseline>And throw them in the entrails of the wolf? </verseline>
<verseline>When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done? </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>When holy Harry died, and my sweet son</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost, </verseline>
<verseline>Woe&#8217;s scene, world&#8217;s shame, grave&#8217;s due by life usurp&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>Brief abstract and record of tedious days, </verseline>
<verseline>Rest thy unrest on England&#8217;s lawful earth, </verseline>
<verseline>[Sitting down] </verseline>
<verseline>Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave </verseline>
<verseline>As thou canst yield a melancholy seat! </verseline>
<verseline>Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here</verseline>
<verseline>Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we? </verseline>
<verseline>[Sitting down by her] </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>[Coming forward] </verseline>
<verseline>If ancient sorrow be most reverend, </verseline>
<verseline>Give mine the benefit of seniory, </verseline>
<verseline>And let my griefs frown on the upper hand</verseline>
<verseline>If sorrow can admit society, </verseline>
<verseline>[Sitting down with them] </verseline>
<verseline>Tell o&#8217;er your woes again by viewing mine</verseline>
<verseline>I had an Edward, till a Richard kill&#8217;d him; </verseline>
<verseline>I had a husband, till a Richard kill&#8217;d him: </verseline>
<verseline>Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill&#8217;d him; </verseline>
<verseline>Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill&#8217;d him</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him; </verseline>
<verseline>I had a Rutland too, thou holp&#8217;st to kill him</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill&#8217;d him</verseline>
<verseline>From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept </verseline>
<verseline>A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death</verseline>
<verseline>That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes </verseline>
<verseline>To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood, </verseline>
<verseline>That foul defacer of God&#8217;s handiwork, </verseline>
<verseline>That excellent grand tyrant of the earth </verseline>
<verseline>That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls, </verseline>
<verseline>Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves</verseline>
<verseline>O upright, just, and true-disposing God, </verseline>
<verseline>How do I thank thee that this carnal cur </verseline>
<verseline>Preys on the issue of his mother&#8217;s body </verseline>
<verseline>And makes her pew-fellow with others&#8217; moan! </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>O Harry&#8217;s wife, triumph not in my woes! </verseline>
<verseline>God witness with me, I have wept for thine</verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge, </verseline>
<verseline>And now I cloy me with beholding it</verseline>
<verseline>Thy Edward he is dead, that kill&#8217;d my Edward; </verseline>
<verseline>The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; </verseline>
<verseline>Young York he is but boot, because both they </verseline>
<verseline>Match&#8217;d not the high perfection of my loss</verseline>
<verseline>Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb&#8217;d my Edward; </verseline>
<verseline>And the beholders of this frantic play, </verseline>
<verseline>Th&#8217; adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, </verseline>
<verseline>Untimely smother&#8217;d in their dusky graves</verseline>
<verseline>Richard yet lives, hell&#8217;s black intelligencer; </verseline>
<verseline>Only reserv&#8217;d their factor to buy souls </verseline>
<verseline>And send them thither. But at hand, at hand, </verseline>
<verseline>Ensues his piteous and unpitied end</verseline>
<verseline>Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray, </verseline>
<verseline>To have him suddenly convey&#8217;d from hence</verseline>
<verseline>Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray, </verseline>
<verseline>That I may live and say &#8216;The dog is dead.&#8217; </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>O, thou didst prophesy the time would come </verseline>
<verseline>That I should wish for thee to help me curse </verseline>
<verseline>That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back&#8217;d toad! </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>I call&#8217;d thee then vain flourish of my fortune; </verseline>
<verseline>I call&#8217;d thee then poor shadow, painted queen, </verseline>
<verseline>The presentation of but what I was, </verseline>
<verseline>The flattering index of a direful pageant, </verseline>
<verseline>One heav&#8217;d a-high to be hurl&#8217;d down below, </verseline>
<verseline>A mother only mock&#8217;d with two fair babes, </verseline>
<verseline>A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag </verseline>
<verseline>To be the aim of every dangerous shot, </verseline>
<verseline>A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble, </verseline>
<verseline>A queen in jest, only to fill the scene</verseline>
<verseline>Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers? </verseline>
<verseline>Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy? </verseline>
<verseline>Who sues, and kneels, and says &#8216;God save the Queen&#8217;? </verseline>
<verseline>Where be the bending peers that flattered thee? </verseline>
<verseline>Where be the thronging troops that followed thee? </verseline>
<verseline>Decline an this, and see what now thou art: </verseline>
<verseline>For happy wife, a most distressed widow; </verseline>
<verseline>For joyful mother, one that wails the name; </verseline>
<verseline>For one being su&#8217;d to, one that humbly sues; </verseline>
<verseline>For Queen, a very caitiff crown&#8217;d with care; </verseline>
<verseline>For she that scorn&#8217;d at me, now scorn&#8217;d of me; </verseline>
<verseline>For she being fear&#8217;d of all, now fearing one; </verseline>
<verseline>For she commanding all, obey&#8217;d of none</verseline>
<verseline>Thus hath the course of justice whirl&#8217;d about </verseline>
<verseline>And left thee but a very prey to time, </verseline>
<verseline>Having no more but thought of what thou wast </verseline>
<verseline>To torture thee the more, being what thou art</verseline>
<verseline>Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not </verseline>
<verseline>Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? </verseline>
<verseline>Now thy proud neck bears half my burden&#8217;d yoke, </verseline>
<verseline>From which even here I slip my weary head </verseline>
<verseline>And leave the burden of it all on thee</verseline>
<verseline>Farewell, York&#8217;s wife, and queen of sad mischance; </verseline>
<verseline>These English woes shall make me smile in France</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>O thou well skill&#8217;d in curses, stay awhile </verseline>
<verseline>And teach me how to curse mine enemies! </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; </verseline>
<verseline>Compare dead happiness with living woe; </verseline>
<verseline>Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, </verseline>
<verseline>And he that slew them fouler than he is</verseline>
<verseline>Bett&#8217;ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse; </verseline>
<verseline>Revolving this will teach thee how to curse</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine! </verseline>
<character>Queen Margaret </character>
<verseline>Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Why should calamity be fun of words? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Windy attorneys to their client woes, </verseline>
<verseline>Airy succeeders of intestate joys, </verseline>
<verseline>Poor breathing orators of miseries, </verseline>
<verseline>Let them have scope; though what they will impart </verseline>
<verseline>Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me, </verseline>
<verseline>And in the breath of bitter words let&#8217;s smother </verseline>
<verseline>My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother&#8217;d</verseline>
<verseline>The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter King Richard and his train, marching with drums and trumpets </stage_directions>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Who intercepts me in my expedition? </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>O, she that might have intercepted thee, </verseline>
<verseline>By strangling thee in her accursed womb, </verseline>
<verseline>From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done! </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown </verseline>
<verseline>Where&#8217;t should be branded, if that right were right, </verseline>
<verseline>The slaughter of the Prince that ow&#8217;d that crown, </verseline>
<verseline>And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers? </verseline>
<verseline>Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children? </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence? </verseline>
<verseline>And little Ned Plantagenet, his son? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, </verseline>
<verseline>Grey? </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Where is kind Hastings? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums! </verseline>
<verseline>Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women </verseline>
<verseline>Rail on the Lord&#8217;s anointed. Strike, I say! </verseline>
<verseline>[Flourish. Alarums] </verseline>
<verseline>Either be patient and entreat me fair, </verseline>
<verseline>Or with the clamorous report of war </verseline>
<verseline>Thus will I drown your exclamations</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Art thou my son? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Then patiently hear my impatience</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Madam, I have a touch of your condition </verseline>
<verseline>That cannot brook the accent of reproof</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>O, let me speak! </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Do, then; but I&#8217;ll not hear</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>I will be mild and gentle in my words</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>And brief, good mother; for I am in haste</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Art thou so hasty? I have stay&#8217;d for thee, </verseline>
<verseline>God knows, in torment and in agony</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>And came I not at last to comfort you? </verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>No, by the holy rood, thou know&#8217;st it well </verseline>
<verseline>Thou cam&#8217;st on earth to make the earth my hell</verseline>
<verseline>A grievous burden was thy birth to me; </verseline>
<verseline>Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; </verseline>
<verseline>Thy school-days frightful, desp&#8217;rate, wild, and furious; </verseline>
<verseline>Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous; </verseline>
<verseline>Thy age confirm&#8217;d, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody, </verseline>
<verseline>More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred</verseline>
<verseline>What comfortable hour canst thou name </verseline>
<verseline>That ever grac&#8217;d me with thy company? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Faith, none but Humphrey Hour, that call&#8217;d your Grace </verseline>
<verseline>To breakfast once forth of my company</verseline>
<verseline>If I be so disgracious in your eye, </verseline>
<verseline>Let me march on and not offend you, madam</verseline>
<verseline>Strike up the drum</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>I prithee hear me speak</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>You speak too bitterly</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Hear me a word; </verseline>
<verseline>For I shall never speak to thee again</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>So</verseline>
<character>Duchess </character>
<verseline>Either thou wilt die by God&#8217;s just ordinance </verseline>
<verseline>Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror; </verseline>
<verseline>Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish </verseline>
<verseline>And never more behold thy face again</verseline>
<verseline>Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse, </verseline>
<verseline>Which in the day of battle tire thee more </verseline>
<verseline>Than all the complete armour that thou wear&#8217;st! </verseline>
<verseline>My prayers on the adverse party fight; </verseline>
<verseline>And there the little souls of Edward&#8217;s children </verseline>
<verseline>Whisper the spirits of thine enemies </verseline>
<verseline>And promise them success and victory</verseline>
<verseline>Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end</verseline>
<verseline>Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend</verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse </verseline>
<verseline>Abides in me; I say amen to her</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>I have no moe sons of the royal blood </verseline>
<verseline>For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard, </verseline>
<verseline>They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens; </verseline>
<verseline>And therefore level not to hit their lives</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>You have a daughter call&#8217;d Elizabeth</verseline>
<verseline>Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>And must she die for this? O, let her live, </verseline>
<verseline>And I&#8217;ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, </verseline>
<verseline>Slander myself as false to Edward&#8217;s bed, </verseline>
<verseline>Throw over her the veil of infamy; </verseline>
<verseline>So she may live unscarr&#8217;d of bleeding slaughter, </verseline>
<verseline>I will confess she was not Edward&#8217;s daughter</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Wrong not her birth; she is a royal Princess</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>To save her life I&#8217;ll say she is not so</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Her life is safest only in her birth</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>And only in that safety died her brothers</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>No, to their lives ill friends were contrary</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>All unavoided is the doom of destiny</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>True, when avoided grace makes destiny</verseline>
<verseline>My babes were destin&#8217;d to a fairer death, </verseline>
<verseline>If grace had bless&#8217;d thee with a fairer life</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>You speak as if that I had slain my cousins</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen&#8217;d </verseline>
<verseline>Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life</verseline>
<verseline>Whose hand soever lanc&#8217;d their tender hearts, </verseline>
<verseline>Thy head, an indirectly, gave direction</verseline>
<verseline>No doubt the murd&#8217;rous knife was dull and blunt </verseline>
<verseline>Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart </verseline>
<verseline>To revel in the entrails of my lambs</verseline>
<verseline>But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame, </verseline>
<verseline>My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys </verseline>
<verseline>Till that my nails were anchor&#8217;d in thine eyes; </verseline>
<verseline>And I, in such a desp&#8217;rate bay of death, </verseline>
<verseline>Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft, </verseline>
<verseline>Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise </verseline>
<verseline>And dangerous success of bloody wars, </verseline>
<verseline>As I intend more good to you and yours </verseline>
<verseline>Than ever you or yours by me were harm&#8217;d! </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>What good is cover&#8217;d with the face of heaven, </verseline>
<verseline>To be discover&#8217;d, that can do me good? </verseline>
<character>King Richard  </character>
<verseline>Advancement of your children, gentle lady</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Unto the dignity and height of Fortune, </verseline>
<verseline>The high imperial type of this earth&#8217;s glory</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Flatter my sorrow with report of it; </verseline>
<verseline>Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour, </verseline>
<verseline>Canst thou demise to any child of mine? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Even all I have-ay, and myself and all </verseline>
<verseline>Will I withal endow a child of thine; </verseline>
<verseline>So in the Lethe of thy angry soul </verseline>
<verseline>Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs </verseline>
<verseline>Which thou supposest I have done to thee</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness </verseline>
<verseline>Last longer telling than thy kindness&#8217; date</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>My daughter&#8217;s mother thinks it with her soul</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>What do you think? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul</verseline>
<verseline>So from thy soul&#8217;s love didst thou love her brothers, </verseline>
<verseline>And from my heart&#8217;s love I do thank thee for it</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Be not so hasty to confound my meaning</verseline>
<verseline>I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter </verseline>
<verseline>And do intend to make her Queen of England</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be her king? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Even he that makes her Queen. Who else should be? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>What, thou? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Even so. How think you of it? </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>How canst thou woo her? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>That would I learn of you, </verseline>
<verseline>As one being best acquainted with her humour</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>And wilt thou learn of me? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Madam, with all my heart</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers, </verseline>
<verseline>A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Edward&#8217; and &#8216;York.&#8217; Then haply will she weep; </verseline>
<verseline>Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret </verseline>
<verseline>Did to thy father, steep&#8217;d in Rutland&#8217;s blood&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain </verseline>
<verseline>The purple sap from her sweet brother&#8217;s body, </verseline>
<verseline>And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal</verseline>
<verseline>If this inducement move her not to love, </verseline>
<verseline>Send her a letter of thy noble deeds; </verseline>
<verseline>Tell her thou mad&#8217;st away her uncle Clarence, </verseline>
<verseline>Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake </verseline>
<verseline>Mad&#8217;st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>You mock me, madam; this is not the way </verseline>
<verseline>To win your daughter</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>There is no other way; </verseline>
<verseline>Unless thou couldst put on some other shape </verseline>
<verseline>And not be Richard that hath done all this</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Say that I did all this for love of her</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, </verseline>
<verseline>Having bought love with such a bloody spoil</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Look what is done cannot be now amended</verseline>
<verseline>Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, </verseline>
<verseline>Which after-hours gives leisure to repent</verseline>
<verseline>If I did take the kingdom from your sons, </verseline>
<verseline>To make amends I&#8217;ll give it to your daughter</verseline>
<verseline>If I have kill&#8217;d the issue of your womb, </verseline>
<verseline>To quicken your increase I will beget </verseline>
<verseline>Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter</verseline>
<verseline>A grandam&#8217;s name is little less in love </verseline>
<verseline>Than is the doating title of a mother; </verseline>
<verseline>They are as children but one step below, </verseline>
<verseline>Even of your metal, of your very blood; </verseline>
<verseline>Of all one pain, save for a night of groans </verseline>
<verseline>Endur&#8217;d of her, for whom you bid like sorrow</verseline>
<verseline>Your children were vexation to your youth; </verseline>
<verseline>But mine shall be a comfort to your age</verseline>
<verseline>The loss you have is but a son being King, </verseline>
<verseline>And by that loss your daughter is made Queen</verseline>
<verseline>I cannot make you what amends I would, </verseline>
<verseline>Therefore accept such kindness as I can</verseline>
<verseline>Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul </verseline>
<verseline>Leads discontented steps in foreign soil, </verseline>
<verseline>This fair alliance quickly shall can home </verseline>
<verseline>To high promotions and great dignity</verseline>
<verseline>The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife, </verseline>
<verseline>Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother; </verseline>
<verseline>Again shall you be mother to a king, </verseline>
<verseline>And all the ruins of distressful times </verseline>
<verseline>Repair&#8217;d with double riches of content</verseline>
<verseline>What! we have many goodly days to see</verseline>
<verseline>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed </verseline>
<verseline>Shall come again, transform&#8217;d to orient pearl, </verseline>
<verseline>Advantaging their loan with interest </verseline>
<verseline>Of ten times double gain of happiness</verseline>
<verseline>Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go; </verseline>
<verseline>Make bold her bashful years with your experience; </verseline>
<verseline>Prepare her ears to hear a wooer&#8217;s tale; </verseline>
<verseline>Put in her tender heart th&#8217; aspiring flame </verseline>
<verseline>Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes </verseline>
<verseline>With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys</verseline>
<verseline>And when this arm of mine hath chastised </verseline>
<verseline>The petty rebel, dull-brain&#8217;d Buckingham, </verseline>
<verseline>Bound with triumphant garlands will I come, </verseline>
<verseline>And lead thy daughter to a conqueror&#8217;s bed; </verseline>
<verseline>To whom I will retail my conquest won, </verseline>
<verseline>And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar&#8217;s Caesar</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>What were I best to say? Her father&#8217;s brother </verseline>
<verseline>Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle? </verseline>
<verseline>Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles? </verseline>
<verseline>Under what title shall I woo for thee </verseline>
<verseline>That God, the law, my honour, and her love </verseline>
<verseline>Can make seem pleasing to her tender years? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Infer fair England&#8217;s peace by this alliance</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Tell her the King, that may command, entreats</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>That at her hands which the King&#8217;s King forbids</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Say she shall be a high and mighty queen</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>To wail the title, as her mother doth</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Say I will love her everlastingly</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>But how long shall that title &#8216;ever&#8217; last? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Sweetly in force unto her fair life&#8217;s end</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>But how long fairly shall her sweet life last? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>As long as heaven and nature lengthens it</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>As long as hell and Richard likes of it</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Be eloquent in my behalf to her</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>An honest tale speeds best being plainly told</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Then plainly to her tell my loving tale</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Plain and not honest is too harsh a style</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Your reasons are too shallow and too quick</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>O, no, my reasons are too deep and dead&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Harp not on that string, madam; that is past</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Profan&#8217;d, dishonour&#8217;d, and the third usurp&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>I swear&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>By nothing; for this is no oath: </verseline>
<verseline>Thy George, profan&#8217;d, hath lost his lordly honour; </verseline>
<verseline>Thy garter, blemish&#8217;d, pawn&#8217;d his knightly virtue; </verseline>
<verseline>Thy crown, usurp&#8217;d, disgrac&#8217;d his kingly glory</verseline>
<verseline>If something thou wouldst swear to be believ&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Then, by my self&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Thy self is self-misus&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Now, by the world&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis full of thy foul wrongs</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>My father&#8217;s death&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Thy life hath it dishonour&#8217;d</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Why, then, by God&#8212; </verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>God&#8217;s wrong is most of all</verseline>
<verseline>If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him, </verseline>
<verseline>The unity the King my husband made </verseline>
<verseline>Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died</verseline>
<verseline>If thou hadst fear&#8217;d to break an oath by Him, </verseline>
<verseline>Th&#8217; imperial metal, circling now thy head, </verseline>
<verseline>Had grac&#8217;d the tender temples of my child; </verseline>
<verseline>And both the Princes had been breathing here, </verseline>
<verseline>Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust, </verseline>
<verseline>Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms</verseline>
<verseline>What canst thou swear by now? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>The time to come</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>That thou hast wronged in the time o&#8217;erpast; </verseline>
<verseline>For I myself have many tears to wash </verseline>
<verseline>Hereafter time, for time past wrong&#8217;d by thee</verseline>
<verseline>The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>Ungovern&#8217;d youth, to wail it in their age; </verseline>
<verseline>The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed, </verseline>
<verseline>Old barren plants, to wail it with their age</verseline>
<verseline>Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast </verseline>
<verseline>Misus&#8217;d ere us&#8217;d, by times ill-us&#8217;d o&#8217;erpast</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>As I intend to prosper and repent, </verseline>
<verseline>So thrive I in my dangerous affairs </verseline>
<verseline>Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound! </verseline>
<verseline>Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours! </verseline>
<verseline>Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest! </verseline>
<verseline>Be opposite all planets of good luck </verseline>
<verseline>To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart&#8217;s love, </verseline>
<verseline>Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, </verseline>
<verseline>I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter</verseline>
<verseline>In her consists my happiness and thine; </verseline>
<verseline>Without her, follows to myself and thee, </verseline>
<verseline>Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul, </verseline>
<verseline>Death, desolation, ruin, and decay</verseline>
<verseline>It cannot be avoided but by this; </verseline>
<verseline>It will not be avoided but by this</verseline>
<verseline>Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>Be the attorney of my love to her; </verseline>
<verseline>Plead what I will be, not what I have been; </verseline>
<verseline>Not my deserts, but what I will deserve</verseline>
<verseline>Urge the necessity and state of times, </verseline>
<verseline>And be not peevish-fond in great designs</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Shall I be tempted of the devil thus? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Shall I forget myself to be myself? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Ay, if your self&#8217;s remembrance wrong yourself</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Yet thou didst kill my children</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>But in your daughter&#8217;s womb I bury them; </verseline>
<verseline>Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed </verseline>
<verseline>Selves of themselves, to your recomforture</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>Shall I go win my daughter to thy will? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>And be a happy mother by the deed</verseline>
<character>Queen Elizabeth </character>
<verseline>I go. Write to me very shortly, </verseline>
<verseline>And you shall understand from me her mind</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Bear her my true love&#8217;s kiss; and so, farewell</verseline>
<stage_directions>Kissing her. Exit Queen Elizabeth </stage_directions>

<verseline>Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast </verseline>
<verseline>Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores </verseline>
<verseline>Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, </verseline>
<verseline>Unarm&#8217;d, and unresolv&#8217;d to beat them back</verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral; </verseline>
<verseline>And there they hull, expecting but the aid </verseline>
<verseline>Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>

<verseline>[To Catesby] </verseline>
<verseline>Dull, unmindfull villain, </verseline>
<verseline>Why stay&#8217;st thou here, and go&#8217;st not to the Duke? </verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness&#8217; pleasure, </verseline>
<verseline>What from your Grace I shall deliver to him</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight </verseline>

<verseline>And meet me suddenly at Salisbury</verseline>
<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>I go </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exit </stage_directions>

<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing; </verseline>

<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad! </verseline>
<verseline>What need&#8217;st thou run so many miles about, </verseline>

<verseline>Once more, what news? </verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>Richmond is on the seas</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>There let him sink, and be the seas on him! </verseline>
<verseline>White-liver&#8217;d runagate, what doth he there? </verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Well, as you guess? </verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>Stirr&#8217;d up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, </verseline>
<verseline>He makes for England here to claim the crown</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway&#8217;d? </verseline>
<verseline>Is the King dead, the empire unpossess&#8217;d? </verseline>
<verseline>What heir of York is there alive but we? </verseline>
<verseline>And who is England&#8217;s King but great York&#8217;s heir? </verseline>
<verseline>Then tell me what makes he upon the seas</verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Unless for that he comes to be your liege, </verseline>
<verseline>You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes</verseline>
<verseline>Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear</verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Where is thy power then, to beat him back? </verseline>
<verseline>Where be thy tenants and thy followers? </verseline>
<verseline>Are they not now upon the western shore, </verseline>
<verseline>Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships? </verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>No, my good lord, my friends are in the north</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Cold friends to me. What do they in the north, </verseline>
<verseline>When they should serve their sovereign in the west? </verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>They have not been commanded, mighty King</verseline>
<verseline>Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave, </verseline>
<verseline>I&#8217;ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace </verseline>
<verseline>Where and what time your Majesty shall please</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond; </verseline>
<verseline>But I&#8217;ll not trust thee</verseline>
<character>Stanley </character>
<verseline>Most mighty sovereign, </verseline>
<verseline>You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful</verseline>
<verseline>I never was nor never will be false</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind </verseline>
<verseline>Your son, George Stanley. Look your heart be firm, </verseline>
<verseline>Or else his head&#8217;s assurance is but frail</verseline>

<verseline>My son George Stanley is frank&#8217;d up in hold; </verseline>
<verseline>If I revolt, off goes young George&#8217;s head; </verseline>
<verseline>The fear of that holds off my present aid</verseline>
<verseline>So, get thee gone; commend me to thy lord</verseline>
<verseline>Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented </verseline>
<verseline>He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter</verseline>

<verseline>Hastings, and Edward&#8217;s children, Grey, and Rivers, </verseline>
<verseline>Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward, </verseline>

<verseline>By underhand corrupted foul injustice, </verseline>
<verseline>If that your moody discontented souls </verseline>

<verseline>This is All-Souls&#8217; day, fellow, is it not? </verseline>
<character>Sheriff </character>
<verseline>It is, my lord</verseline>
<character>Buckingham </character>
<verseline>Why, then All-Souls&#8217; day is my body&#8217;s doomsday</verseline>
<verseline>This is the day which in King Edward&#8217;s time </verseline>
<verseline>I wish&#8217;d might fall on me when I was found </verseline>
<verseline>False to his children and his wife&#8217;s allies; </verseline>
<verseline>This is the day wherein I wish&#8217;d to fall </verseline>
<verseline>By the false faith of him whom most I trusted; </verseline>
<verseline>This, this All-Souls&#8217; day to my fearful soul </verseline>
<verseline>Is the determin&#8217;d respite of my wrongs; </verseline>
<verseline>That high All-Seer which I dallied with </verseline>
<verseline>Hath turn&#8217;d my feigned prayer on my head </verseline>
<verseline>And given in earnest what I begg&#8217;d in jest</verseline>
<verseline>Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men </verseline>

<verseline>Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn</verseline>
<verseline>From Tamworth thither is but one day&#8217;s march</verseline>

<verseline>Why, our battalia trebles that account; </verseline>
<verseline>Besides, the King&#8217;s name is a tower of strength, </verseline>

<verseline>By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night </verseline>

<verseline>I promise you my soul is very jocund </verseline>
<verseline>In the remembrance of so fair a dream</verseline>
<verseline>How far into the morning is it, lords? </verseline>
<character>Lords </character>
<verseline>Upon the stroke of four</verseline>
<character>Richmond </character>
<verseline>Why, then &#8216;tis time to arm and give direction</verseline>
<stage_directions>His Oration to his Soldiers </stage_directions>
<verseline>More than I have said, loving countrymen, </verseline>
<verseline>The leisure and enforcement of the time </verseline>
<verseline>Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this: </verseline>
<verseline>God and our good cause fight upon our side; </verseline>
<verseline>The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, </verseline>
<verseline>Like high-rear&#8217;d bulwarks, stand before our faces; </verseline>
<verseline>Richard except, those whom we fight against </verseline>
<verseline>Had rather have us win than him they follow</verseline>
<verseline>For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen, </verseline>
<verseline>A bloody tyrant and a homicide; </verseline>
<verseline>One rais&#8217;d in blood, and one in blood establish&#8217;d; </verseline>
<verseline>One that made means to come by what he hath, </verseline>
<verseline>And slaughtered those that were the means to help him; </verseline>
<verseline>A base foul stone, made precious by the foil </verseline>
<verseline>Of England&#8217;s chair, where he is falsely set; </verseline>
<verseline>One that hath ever been God&#8217;s enemy</verseline>
<verseline>Then if you fight against God&#8217;s enemy, </verseline>
<verseline>God will in justice ward you as his soldiers; </verseline>
<verseline>If you do sweat to put a tyrant down, </verseline>
<verseline>You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain; </verseline>
<verseline>If you do fight against your country&#8217;s foes, </verseline>
<verseline>Your country&#8217;s foes shall pay your pains the hire; </verseline>
<verseline>If you do fight in safeguard of your wives, </verseline>
<verseline>Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors; </verseline>
<verseline>If you do free your children from the sword, </verseline>
<verseline>Your children&#8217;s children quits it in your age</verseline>
<verseline>Then, in the name of God and all these rights, </verseline>
<verseline>Advance your standards, draw your willing swords</verseline>
<verseline>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt </verseline>
<verseline>Shall be this cold corpse on the earth&#8217;s cold face; </verseline>
<verseline>But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt </verseline>
<verseline>The least of you shall share his part thereof</verseline>
<verseline>Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully; </verseline>
<verseline>God and Saint George! Richmond and victory! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt </stage_directions>
<stage_directions>Re-enter King Richard, Ratcliff, attendants, and forces </stage_directions>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>What said Northumberland as touching Richmond? </verseline>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>That he was never trained up in arms</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>He said the truth; and what said Surrey then? </verseline>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>He smil&#8217;d, and said &#8216;The better for our purpose.&#8217; </verseline>
<character>King  </character>
<verseline>He was in the right; and so indeed it is</verseline>
<verseline>[Clock strikes] </verseline>
<verseline>Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar</verseline>
<verseline>Who saw the sun to-day? </verseline>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>Not I, my lord</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Then he disdains to shine; for by the book </verseline>
<verseline>He should have brav&#8217;d the east an hour ago</verseline>
<verseline>A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff! </verseline>
<character>Ratcliff </character>
<verseline>My lord? </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>The sun will not be seen to-day; </verseline>
<verseline>The sky doth frown and lour upon our army</verseline>
<verseline>I would these dewy tears were from the ground</verseline>
<verseline>Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me </verseline>
<verseline>More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven </verseline>
<verseline>That frowns on me looks sadly upon him</verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter Norfolk </stage_directions>
<character>Norfolk </character>
<verseline>Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse; </verseline>
<verseline>Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power</verseline>
<verseline>I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, </verseline>
<verseline>And thus my battle shall be ordered: </verseline>
<verseline>My foreward shall be drawn out all in length, </verseline>
<verseline>Consisting equally of horse and foot; </verseline>
<verseline>Our archers shall be placed in the midst</verseline>
<verseline>John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey, </verseline>
<verseline>Shall have the leading of this foot and horse</verseline>
<verseline>They thus directed, we will follow </verseline>
<verseline>In the main battle, whose puissance on either side </verseline>
<verseline>Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse</verseline>
<verseline>This, and Saint George to boot! What think&#8217;st thou, Norfolk? </verseline>
<character>Norfolk </character>
<verseline>A good direction, warlike sovereign</verseline>
<verseline>This found I on my tent this morning</verseline>
<verseline>[He sheweth him a paper] </verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>[Reads] </verseline>
<verseline>&#8216;Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold, </verseline>
<verseline>For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.&#8217; </verseline>
<verseline>A thing devised by the enemy</verseline>
<verseline>Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge</verseline>
<verseline>Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls; </verseline>
<verseline>Conscience is but a word that cowards use, </verseline>
<verseline>Devis&#8217;d at first to keep the strong in awe</verseline>
<verseline>Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law</verseline>
<verseline>March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell; </verseline>
<verseline>If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell</verseline>
<stage_directions>His Oration to his Army </stage_directions>
<verseline>What shall I say more than I have inferr&#8217;d? </verseline>
<verseline>Remember whom you are to cope withal- </verseline>
<verseline>A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways, </verseline>
<verseline>A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants, </verseline>
<verseline>Whom their o&#8217;er-cloyed country vomits forth </verseline>
<verseline>To desperate adventures and assur&#8217;d destruction</verseline>
<verseline>You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest; </verseline>
<verseline>You having lands, and bless&#8217;d with beauteous wives, </verseline>
<verseline>They would restrain the one, distain the other</verseline>
<verseline>And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow, </verseline>
<verseline>Long kept in Britaine at our mother&#8217;s cost? </verseline>
<verseline>A milk-sop, one that never in his life </verseline>
<verseline>Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow? </verseline>
<verseline>Let&#8217;s whip these stragglers o&#8217;er the seas again; </verseline>
<verseline>Lash hence these over-weening rags of France, </verseline>
<verseline>These famish&#8217;d beggars, weary of their lives; </verseline>
<verseline>Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit, </verseline>
<verseline>For want of means, poor rats, had hang&#8217;d themselves</verseline>
<verseline>If we be conquered, let men conquer us, </verseline>
<verseline>And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers </verseline>
<verseline>Have in their own land beaten, bobb&#8217;d, and thump&#8217;d, </verseline>
<verseline>And, in record, left them the heirs of shame</verseline>
<verseline>Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives, </verseline>
<verseline>Ravish our daughters? </verseline>
<verseline>[Drum afar off] </verseline>
<verseline>Hark! I hear their drum</verseline>
<verseline>Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen! </verseline>
<verseline>Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head! </verseline>
<verseline>Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood; </verseline>
<verseline>Amaze the welkin with your broken staves! </verseline>
<stage_directions>Enter a Messenger </stage_directions>
<verseline>What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power? </verseline>
<character>Messenger </character>
<verseline>My lord, he doth deny to come</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Off with his son George&#8217;s head! </verseline>
<character>Norfolk </character>
<verseline>My lord, the enemy is pass&#8217;d the marsh</verseline>
<verseline>After the battle let George Stanley die</verseline>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>A thousand hearts are great within my bosom</verseline>
<verseline>Advance our standards, set upon our foes; </verseline>
<verseline>Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George, </verseline>
<verseline>Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons! </verseline>
<verseline>Upon them! Victory sits on our helms</verseline>

<character>Catesby </character>
<verseline>Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue! </verseline>
<verseline>The King enacts more wonders than a man, </verseline>
<verseline>Daring an opposite to every danger</verseline>
<verseline>His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, </verseline>
<verseline>Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death</verseline>
<verseline>Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost</verseline>
<stage_directions>Alarums. Enter King Richard </stage_directions>
<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! </verseline>

<character>King Richard </character>
<verseline>Slave, I have set my life upon a cast </verseline>
<verseline>And I Will stand the hazard of the die</verseline>
<verseline>I think there be six Richmonds in the field; </verseline>
<verseline>Five have I slain to-day instead of him</verseline>
<verseline>A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!  </verseline>
<stage_directions>Exeunt </stage_directions>
<scene>Scene 5</scene>
<location>Another part of the field </location>
<stage_directions> Alarum. Enter Richard and Richmond; they fight; Richard is slain. Retreat and flourish. Enter Richmond, Derby bearing the crown, with other Lords </stage_directions>
<character>Richmond </character>
<verseline>God and your arms be prais&#8217;d, victorious friends; </verseline>
<verseline>The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead</verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee! </verseline>
<verseline>Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty </verseline>
<verseline>From the dead temples of this bloody wretch </verseline>
<verseline>Have I pluck&#8217;d off, to grace thy brows withal</verseline>
<verseline>Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it</verseline>
<character>Richmond </character>
<verseline>Great God of heaven, say Amen to all! </verseline>
<verseline>But, tell me is young George Stanley living</verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town, </verseline>
<verseline>Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us</verseline>
<character>Richmond </character>
<verseline>What men of name are slain on either side? </verseline>
<character>Derby </character>
<verseline>John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers, </verseline>
<verseline>Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon</verseline>
<character>Richmond </character>
<verseline>Inter their bodies as becomes their births</verseline>
<verseline>Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled </verseline>
<verseline>That in submission will return to us</verseline>
<verseline>And then, as we have ta&#8217;en the sacrament, </verseline>
<verseline>We will unite the white rose and the red</verseline>
<verseline>Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, </verseline>
<verseline>That long have frown&#8217;d upon their emnity! </verseline>
<verseline>What traitor hears me, and says not Amen? </verseline>
<verseline>England hath long been mad, and scarr&#8217;d herself; </verseline>
<verseline>The brother blindly shed the brother&#8217;s blood, </verseline>
<verseline>The father rashly slaughter&#8217;d his own son, </verseline>
<verseline>The son, compell&#8217;d, been butcher to the sire; </verseline>
<verseline>All this divided York and Lancaster, </verseline>
<verseline>Divided in their dire division, </verseline>
<verseline>O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth, </verseline>
<verseline>The true succeeders of each royal house, </verseline>
<verseline>By God&#8217;s fair ordinance conjoin together! </verseline>
<verseline>And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so, </verseline>
<verseline>Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac&#8217;d peace, </verseline>
<verseline>With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days! </verseline>
<verseline>Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, </verseline>
<verseline>That would reduce these bloody days again </verseline>
<verseline>And make poor England weep in streams of blood! </verseline>
<verseline>Let them not live to taste this land&#8217;s increase </verseline>
<verseline>That would with treason wound this fair land&#8217;s peace! </verseline>
<verseline>Now civil wounds are stopp&#8217;d, peace lives again&#8212; </verseline>
<verseline>That she may long live here, God say Amen! </verseline>
