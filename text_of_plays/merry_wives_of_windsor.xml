I am damn&#8217;d in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took &#8216;t upon mine honour thou hadst it not</prose> <character>Pistol</character> <prose>Didst not thou share?

You stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the terms of my honour precise. I, I, I myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand, and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour! You will not do it, you!</prose> <character>Pistol</character> <prose>I do relent; what would thou more of man?</prose> <stage_directions>Enter Robin</stage_directions> <character>Robin</character> <prose>Sir, here&#8217;s a woman would speak with you</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Let her approach</prose> <stage_directions>Enter Mistress Quickly</stage_directions> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Give your worship good morrow</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Good morrow, good wife</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Not so, an&#8217;t please your worship</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Good maid, then</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>I&#8217;ll be sworn; As my mother was, the first hour I was born</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>I do believe the swearer. What with me?</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Two thousand, fair woman; and I&#8217;ll vouchsafe thee the hearing</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>There is one Mistress Ford, sir-I pray, come a little nearer this ways. I myself dwell with Master Doctor Caius</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say-</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Your worship says very true. I pray your worship come a little nearer this ways</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>I warrant thee nobody hears-mine own people, mine own people</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Are they so? God bless them, and make them his servants!</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Well; Mistress Ford, what of her?</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Why, sir, she&#8217;s a good creature. Lord, Lord, your worship&#8217;s a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you, and all of us, I pray</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford-</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you have brought her into such a canaries as &#8216;tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any woman&#8217;s heart; and I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of honesty; and, I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all; and yet there has been earls, nay, which is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she- Mercury</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Marry, she hath receiv&#8217;d your letter; for the which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Ten and eleven?</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him! He&#8217;s a very jealousy man; she leads a very frampold life with him, good heart</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she&#8217;s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe&#8217;er be the other; and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man: surely I think you have charms, la! Yes, in truth</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Blessing on your heart for &#8216;t!</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford&#8217;s wife and Page&#8217;s wife acquainted each other how they love me?</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope-that were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page of all loves. Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page; and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does; do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she deserves it; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page; no remedy</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Why, I will</prose> <character>Quickly</character> <prose>Nay, but do so then; and, look you, he may come and go between you both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another&#8217;s mind, and the boy never need to understand any thing; for &#8216;tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Fare thee well; commend me to them both. There&#8217;s my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with this woman.  [Exeunt Quickly and Robin]   This news distracts me</prose> <character>Pistol</character> <prose> [Aside]  This punk is one of Cupid&#8217;s carriers; Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights; Give fire; she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!

I shall discover a thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection; but, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you yourself know how easy is it to be such an offender</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Very well, sir; proceed</prose> <character>Ford</character> <verseline>There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband&#8217;s</verseline> <verseline>name is Ford</verseline> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Well, sir</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>I have long lov&#8217;d her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting observance; engross&#8217;d opportunities to meet her; fee&#8217;d every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her; not only bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to many to know what she would have given; briefly, I have pursu&#8217;d her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed, I am sure, I have received none, unless experience be a jewel; that I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this: &#8216;Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues; Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.&#8217;</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Have you receiv&#8217;d no promise of satisfaction at her hands?</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>Never</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Have you importun&#8217;d her to such a purpose?</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>Never</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Of what quality was your love, then?</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>Like a fair house built on another man&#8217;s ground; so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where erected it</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allow&#8217;d for your many war-like, courtlike, and learned preparations</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>O, sir!</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford&#8217;s wife; use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you; if any man may, you may as soon as any</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection, that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to be look&#8217;d against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves; I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defences, which now are too too strongly embattl&#8217;d against me. What say you to&#8217;t, Sir John?</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford&#8217;s wife</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>O good sir!</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>I say you shall</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in to me her assistant, or go-between, parted from me; I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave, her husband, will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall know how I speed</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, Sir?</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not; yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the which his wife seems to me well-favour&#8217;d. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue&#8217;s coffer; and there&#8217;s my harvest-home</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I willstare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel;it shall hang like a meteor o&#8217;er the cuckold&#8217;s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford&#8217;s a knave, and I will aggravate his style; thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. Come to me soon at night</prose> <stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions> <character>Ford</character> <prose>What a damn&#8217;d Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to him; the hour is fix&#8217;d; the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abus&#8217;d, my coffers ransack&#8217;d, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not only receive this villainous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils&#8217; additions, the names of fiends. But cuckold! Wittol! Cuckold! the devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife; he will not be jealous; I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be prais&#8217;d for my jealousy! Eleven o&#8217;clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be reveng&#8217;d on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late.

O, here hecomes</prose> <stage_directions>Enter Ford disguised</stage_directions> <character>Ford</character> <prose>Bless you, sir!</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Now, Master Brook, you come to know what hath pass&#8217;d between me and Ford&#8217;s wife?</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>That, indeed, Sir John, is my business</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Master Brook, I will not lie to you; I was at her house the hour she appointed me</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>And sped you, sir?</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Very ill-favouredly, Master Brook</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>How so, sir; did she change her determination?</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>No. Master Brook; but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual &#8216;larum of</prose> <prose>jealousy, comes me in the instant of our, encounter, after we had embrac&#8217;d, kiss&#8217;d, protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither provoked and instigated by his distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wife&#8217;s love</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>What, while you were there?</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>While I was there</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>And did he search for you, and could not find you?</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page, gives intelligence of Ford&#8217;s approach; and, in her invention and Ford&#8217;s wife&#8217;s distraction, they convey&#8217;d me into a buck-basket</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>A buck-basket!</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>By the Lord, a buck-basket! Ramm&#8217;d me in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>And how long lay you there?</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffer&#8217;d to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus cramm&#8217;d in the basket, a couple of Ford&#8217;s knaves, his hinds, were call&#8217;d forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane; they took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door; who ask&#8217;d them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quak&#8217;d for fear lest the lunatic knave would have search&#8217;d it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook-I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compass&#8217;d like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then, to be stopp&#8217;d in, like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that -a man of my kidney. Think of that-that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I was more than half-stew&#8217;d in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames, and cool&#8217;d, glowing hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that -hissing hot. Think of that, Master Brook</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffer&#8217;d all this. My suit, then, is desperate; you&#8217;ll undertake her no more</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding; I have received from her another embassy of meeting; &#8216;twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook</prose> <character>Ford</character> <prose>&#8216;Tis past eight already, sir</prose> <character>Falstaff</character> <prose>Is it? I Will then address me to my appointment. Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.      </prose> <stage_directions>Exit</stage_directions> <character>Ford</character> <prose>Hum! ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep? Master Ford, awake; awake, Master Ford. There&#8217;s a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford. This &#8216;tis to be married; this &#8216;tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am; I will now take the lecher; he is at my house. He cannot scape me; &#8216;tis impossible he should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse nor into a pepper box. But, lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame.
